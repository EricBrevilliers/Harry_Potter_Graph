{{Quote|Marlene McKinnon, she was killed two weeks after this was taken. They got her whole family.|[[Alastor Moody]] to [[Harry Potter]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
'''Marlene McKinnon''' (d. [[July]] [[1981]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and member of the original [[Order of the Phoenix]]. She fought in the [[First Wizarding War]] and was murdered by [[Death Eaters]], along with her [[McKinnon family|family]].<ref name="OOTP9"/> The McKinnons were later described as being one of the families Voldemort and his followers completely wiped out.

==Biography==
{{Quote|No one ever lived after he decided ter kill 'em, no one except you, an' he'd killed some o' the best witches an' wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the [[Bones family|Bones]], the [[Prewett family|Prewetts]] —|[[Rubeus Hagrid]] telling [[Harry Potter]] about Voldemort's murder of the McKinnon family|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
Marlene was a member of the wizarding [[McKinnon family]],<ref name="PS4">{{PS|B|4}}</ref> which, according to Hagrid, consisted of some of the best witches and wizards of their age, implying that Marlene too was a very accomplished witch.

During the [[First Wizarding War]], Marlene McKinnon became a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], an organisation led and founded by [[Albus Dumbledore]], in order to oppose [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]]. She fought in several battles of the First Wizarding War.<ref name="OOTP9"/> The McKinnons were said to be one of the families killed off by Voldemort, as [[Rubeus Hagrid]] told Harry in his first year, when pushed to discuss the matter.<ref name="PS4"/>

Marlene and her whole family were murdered by [[Death Eaters]] in July 1981.<ref name="death" /> [[Igor Karkaroff]] implicated [[Travers]] as one of the people who was involved.<ref name="GOF30">{{GOF|B|30}}</ref> "[[Mad-Eye Moody|Mad-Eye" Moody]] pointed Marlene out to [[Harry Potter]] in a photo of the Order that was taken two weeks before her death.<ref name="OOTP9">{{OOTP|B|9}}</ref>

==Etymology==
"Marlene" is a name of Germanic origin, and is a blend of the names "Maria" and "Magdaline", which mean "star of the sea" and "of Magdala" respectively. The name "McKinnon" is Scottish, an Anglicised version of the Gaelic name "Mac Fhionghuin", meaning "fair born" or "fair son". It is also translated as "love".

==Behind the scenes==
*Although the [[McKinnon family]] is mentioned throughout the book series, as well in {{OOTP|FA}}, Marlene is the only member of the family who has been identified as working for the Order.
*[[Lily Potter (I)|Lily J. Potter]] says in [[Lily Potter's letter|her letter]] to [[Sirius Black]] that she cried all night when she heard about the McKinnons' deaths, and she attributes [[Peter Pettigrew]]'s melancholy to the same reason, which might suggest that Lily and the [[Marauders]] were close to Marlene and/or her family.
*It is unknown why the McKinnons were all together when they were killed or how they were related to each other. It is possible that they were a nuclear family living in one household and consisting of parents and young children (in which case, Marlene might have been either a mother or an older daughter to the family) or that they were brought to one location by an unidentified family event, known to the Death Eaters who killed them.
*An early manuscript for {{PS}} depicts [[Rubeus Hagrid]] informing a Muggle minister named Fudge about the kidnapping of two characters called "[[Angus McKinnon|Angus]] and [[Elspeth McKinnon]]" by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], who wished to turn them to his side. It would seem that this scene was replaced by the first chapter of [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|''Half Blood Prince'']], and that both characters were conflated into Marlene. However, the final text does make references to "''the McKinnons''", implying a family beyond Marlene, so it is quite unclear if they do exist in canon or not.<ref name="relatives"/>
