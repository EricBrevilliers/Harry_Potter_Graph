'''Hestia Jones''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] during the [[Second Wizarding War]]. She was part of the [[Advance Guard]] in [[1995]]<ref name="OOTP3"/> and later escorted the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] from [[4 Privet Drive|their home]] to a safe location, along with [[Dedalus Diggle]].<ref name="DH3"/>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Hestia Jones was born somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]] no later than the year of [[1978]], presumably into a wizarding family.<ref name="blood"/> Since she did not appear in the [[Order of the Phoenix photograph|photograph]] or had otherwise been indicated of having been a member of the original Order, she might have been too young at the time, and possibly attended school during or after the [[First Wizarding War]].

===Second Wizarding War {{c|1995-1998}}===
Hestia joined the reconstituted [[Order of the Phoenix]] after the return of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. She presumably fought in several battles during the [[Second Wizarding War]], including the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

[[File:B5C3M1 Advance Guard at Privet Drive.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The [[Advance Guard]] assigned to protect Harry Potter]]
She was among the members of the [[Advance Guard]], a group of members of the Order who had volunteered to escort [[Harry Potter]] safely from the house of his aunt and uncle at [[4 Privet Drive]] in [[Surrey]] to their headquarters at [[12 Grimmauld Place]] in [[London]]. Whilst examining the [[Dursley family|Dursley]]'s kitchen, she came across a [[potato peeler]] in a drawer and found it was very funny. A few days later, Hestia borrowed Alastor Moody's invisibility cloak after relieving [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] of guard duty and stood watch over the entrance of the [[Department of Mysteries]] in order to prevent [[Death Eaters]] from entering the area to steal a [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|prophecy]] [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] wished to get a hold of.<ref name="OOTP3">{{OOTP|B|3}}</ref>

In [[1997]], she escorted the Dursleys from their home to a safe location. Hestia was surprised when she saw that the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] did not care about Harry at all and also got very angry when they said that they did not know where Harry was about to go. It can be assumed she played a role in ensuring the continued safety at the safe house for them.<ref name="DH3">{{DH|B|3}}</ref>

===The Calamity===
When the [[Calamity]] broke out in the late [[2010s]], Hestia Jones, along with former members of the Order, played a part in helping members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] to prepare for the challenges they would be facing in containing the situation. She held a workshop that members of the aforementioned task force attended, to whom she demonstrated a 'rigorous methodology' for how to cast [[hex]]es and [[charm]]s with 'perfect form'.<ref name="Form">{{WU}}: ([https://web.archive.org/web/20211009045941/https://wizardsunitehub.info/profession-skill/perfect-form// See here])</ref> She was also invited by [[Harry Potter]] to the [[Auror Office]] to hold a special lesson for those members of the S.O.S. pursuing a future career as an [[Auror]], where she taught them how to maintain one's [[Shield Charm]] against an onslaught, such as a barrage of successive spells or one, big, immensely destructive one.<ref name="Form"/>

==Physical appearance==
Hestia was described as a young, black-haired woman with pink cheeks.<ref name="OOTP3"/>

==Personality and traits==
Hestia was a good, kind person who liked Harry Potter and was shocked when she learned that his uncle, aunt, and cousin did not know where he was going in 1997. She was also quite a tactful person, suggesting that Dedalus and herself should wait outside whilst Harry and the Dursleys said goodbye to each other. This shows that she did not know much about Harry's relationship with the Dursleys as well as the fact that she was quite a caring person.<ref name="DH3"/> She also appeared to be rather intelligent, cleverly seeing past the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]'s [[Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter|denial of the Dark Lord's return]]. She was also one of the few who was unafraid to call Voldemort by his true name. 

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Excelling in both defensive and offensive combative magic, in a duel, Hestia would employ a rigorous methodology to her spell-casting, and was sufficiently adept at [[Shield Charm|Shield Charms]] to withstand an onslaught. During the [[Second Wizarding War]], she were one of the Order members on rotation to guard the [[Department of Mysteries]] from [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] break-in from breaking and protect the prophecy.<ref name="OOTP3" /> She, along with [[Dedalus Diggle]] were also tasked with the protection of the [[Dursley family]] from the [[Death Eaters]] following the [[Fall of the British Ministry of Magic]].<ref name="DH3" /> Her skills were such that she eventually helped to train members of the then recently established [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] who pursued a career as an [[Auror]].<ref name="WU2">{{WU}}</ref>
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Hestia was able to successfully teach trainee [[Auror]]s how to perform numerous defensive charms, most notably the [[Shield Charm]].<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref> In addition, Hestia was capable of casting a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm]].<ref name="LEGOY2" /> 
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Hestia was an accomplished [[broomstick]] flyer; she was a member of the [[Advance Guard]] who escorted Harry Potter to 12 Grimmauld Place via broomstick flight.<ref name="OOTP3"/> Also as seen during the instance where she escorted Harry alongside her allies, Hestia was a sufficiently skilled flyer to have confidence in her ability to handle potential attacks while flying, which even fellow Order member [[Nymphadora Tonks]], who was a trained [[Auror]], remarked to be very difficult.<ref name="DH5">{{DH|B|5}}</ref>

==Relationships==
===Harry Potter===
[[File:Harry Potter movies hbp promostills 6.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Harry Potter]]]]
Hestia showed a fondness for Harry Potter when she first met him in [[1995]]. She was a member of the [[Advance Guard]], a group of members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] which safely escorted Harry from [[4 Privet Drive]] to [[12 Grimmauld Place]].<ref name="OOTP3"/> She met Harry again in [[1997]], when she and [[Dedalus Diggle]] helped the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] hide from [[Death Eaters]]. She was surprised and very angry when she saw that the Dursleys were not proud of Harry, and that they even did not care about where he would go when he left their home.<ref name="DH3"/>

===The Dursleys===
{{Quote|Don't these people realise what you've been through? What danger you are in? The [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|unique position]] you hold in the hearts of the [[Order of the Phoenix|anti-Voldemort movement]]?|Hestia talking to Harry Potter about the Dursleys|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Dursley Family.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The [[Dursley family]]]]
Hestia did not have a good start to her relationship with the Dursleys, and she rather disliked them for their ignorance and selfishness. She was surprised and very angry, when she saw that they did not love Harry at all and that they did not care about where he would go after he would leave their house.<ref name="DH3"/> However, the relationship between Hestia and the Dursleys may have improved as they were hidden from [[Death Eaters]] together, but this is unlikely given that the Dursleys were [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] who very much feared magic and wizards.

===Order of the Phoenix members===
[[File:Order of the Phoenix – first generation.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The first [[Order of the Phoenix]]]]
Hestia had a good relationship with the most of the Order of the Phoenix members, including [[Remus Lupin]], [[Alastor Moody]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], [[Elphias Doge]], [[Dedalus Diggle]], [[Emmeline Vance]], and [[Sturgis Podmore]], as they were all members of the [[Advance Guard]] in [[1995]]. Most of them were killed in battles an it is unknown how Hestia reacted when she learned about their deaths. She may also have been a friend of [[Albus Dumbledore]] and she possibly attended his funeral.

==Etymology==
Hestia is named after the Greek goddess Hestia, who is the goddess of the hearth and of the right ordering of domesticity and the family. The link between Hestia Jones and the Greek goddess Hestia is cleverly underlined by [[J. K. Rowling|Rowling]] in {{OOTP}}, as during Harry's introduction to Hestia, she waves from next to the toaster.

==Behind the scenes==
*She might possibly be related to [[Megan Jones]], [[Peter Jones]] and [[Gwenog Jones]], although Jones is a common English surname.
