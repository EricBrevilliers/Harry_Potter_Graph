==Etymology==
The name "Edgar" is derived from the Old English elements ''ead'' "rich, blessed" and ''gar'' "spear". This was the name of a 10th-century English king who is regarded as a saint. The name did not survive long after the Norman conquest, but it was revived in the 18th century, in part due to a character by this name in Sir Walter Scott's novel 'The Bride of Lammermoor' (1819).

==Behind the scenes==
