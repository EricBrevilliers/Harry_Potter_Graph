==Behind the scenes==
*Circe was a minor goddess in Greek mythology, said to transform sailors lost around her island of [[Aeaea]] into animals via the use of enchanted food. She is perhaps most well known as a figure in Homer's ''Odyssey'', where the hero Odysseus spent a year on her island after freeing his shipmates from her spells.
*Because of her appearance in said Greek texts, Circe is considered by scholars to be the first traditional witch to appear in literature.
