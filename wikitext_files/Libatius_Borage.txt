'''Libatius Borage''' was a [[South America]]n [[wizardkind|wizard]], widely considered "''one of the world's most famous [[potioneer]]s''".<ref name="PM">{{HPcom|castelobruxo}}</ref>

==Biography==
In his youth, he attended the [[wizarding school]] of [[Castelobruxo]] in [[Brazil]].<ref name="PM"/>

Among his many published works are ''[[Advanced Potion-Making]]'', ''[[Asiatic Anti-Venoms]]'' and ''[[Have Yourself a Fiesta in a Bottle!]]''<ref name="PM"/> — the first and second of which are used at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], as a textbook for [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level classes,<ref name="HBP9">{{HBP|B|9}}</ref> and as a reference text for [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]]-level classes,<ref name="OP16">{{OOTP|B|16}}</ref> respectively.

In the [[1980s]], Borage's portrait was hung in the [[Hippogriff Clubhouse]].<ref name="HM">{{HM}}</ref> During the [[1986–1987 school year]], [[Jacob's sibling]] consulted with the portrait while trying to determine what was in a package destroyed by the baby [[Occamy]], [[Squawk]]. Partly from clues that the portrait gave them, the students deduced that the package contained a copy of Borage's book "[[Have Yourself a Fiesta in a Bottle!]]", sent to the [[Hogwarts Hippogriff Club]] as a goodwill gift by [[Castelobruxo Hippogriff Club|their counterparts]] at [[Castelobruxo]]. Fortunately, the club members were eventually able to restore the book with ''[[Papyrus Reparo]]'' and sent the Castelobruxo club some [[Laughing Potion]] that they had brewed from the book's recipe in return.<ref name="ABO">{{HM|3|A BAD OMEN}}</ref> Also by this time, someone had written a [[Biography of Libatius Borage|biography of Borage]], with a copy being stored in the [[Hogwarts Library]].<ref name="RCB">{{HM|6|THE RISE OF A CURSE-BREAKER}}</ref>

During the [[Calamity]] in the late [[2010s]] or early [[2020s]], the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] used Borage's ''[[Advanced Potion-Making]]'' as a template for their potion-brewing guidelines. The [[British Ministry of Magic]] later asked a [[Calamity Investigator]] working for the task force to revise these guidelines, with the investigator updating Borage's basic standard in such a way that their [[Strong Invigoration Draught]]'s effectiveness was improved.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Borage was a highly accomplished and skilled [[potioneer]] in his lifetime, having written several books on the subject and was considered to be one the most famous potioneers in the world.<ref name="PM"/><ref name="HBP9"/> Despite Borage's accomplishments, [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] [[Potions Master]] [[Severus Snape]] seemed to be more adept at [[Potions (class)|potion-making]]. During Snape's student days at Hogwarts, he added many annotations to [[Severus Snape's copy of Advanced Potion-Making|his copy]] of Borage's ''[[Advanced Potion-Making]]'', significantly improving the recipes.<ref name="HBP9"/>
*'''[[Alchemy]]''': Borage also had significant knowledge in the field of Alchemy, having written about the subject extensively in ''[[Advanced Potion-Making]]''.<ref name="HBPF">{{HBP|F}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Libatius Borage's name probably derived from libation, a ritual offering of drink to the gods, and Borage, an edible herb believed to bestow excitement and courage in the hearts of those who consumed it.

==Behind the scenes==
*Although [[William Weasley's South American pen-friend|Bill Weasley's pen pal]] has been mentioned before, Libatius is the first [[Castelobruxo]] student to appear in the series.
