==Biography==
===Early life===
Bott was born in the year [[1935]], somewhere in [[Great Britain]].<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref><ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref>

===Invention of Every Flavour Beans===
[[File:Bertie Bott USA Card.jpg|200px|thumb|left|A younger Bott inventing his beans]]
During years of his life, Bott dedicated himself to confectionary and sweets production. One day, in the mid-[[20th century]], Bott made a mistake that would make him famous: while trying to create tasty sweets from food, a pair of dirty socks were accidentally included in the experiment. Recognising the sales potential of sweets that presented "''a risk with every mouthful''", Bott started commercialising them under the name [[Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans]]. For the invention of these famous sweets, Bott is featured on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref><ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref>

In the [[1993–1994 school year]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], a [[portrait]] of him guarded a secret room; the password to enter was "''Bibble''".<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*[[Albus Dumbledore]] said that in his youth he had a vomit-flavoured bean and no longer liked them.<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref> Dumbledore would have been at least in his fifties at this time, but considering his age he might have considered himself young then.
