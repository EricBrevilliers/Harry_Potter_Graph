{{Quote|Landlady of the [[Three Broomsticks Inn|Three Broomsticks]], famed for her good looks and [[mulled mead]].|Description|Pottermore}}
'''Madam Rosmerta''' (fl. 1970s–2010s) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who was the landlady of the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]] pub in the village of [[Hogsmeade]].<ref name="POA10"/> Rosmerta was put under the [[Imperius Curse]], cast by [[Draco Malfoy]] in [[1997]]. After being placed under the [[curse]], she helped Malfoy against her will to smuggle cursed items into [[Hogwarts Castle]].<ref name="HBP12" /><ref name="HBP27" /> It is likely she later redeemed herself by fighting in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Rosmerta was born into a family of unknown wizarding descent no later than [[1955]]<ref>This would have made her either around 18 by the time the Marauders began visiting Hogsmeade in their third year during the 1973–1974 school year, and hence out of school and employable at the time.</ref> and attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] during her formative years.<ref name="HManniversary"/>

===Bartender at the Three Broomsticks===
{{Quote|I was a barmaid at the time, barely old enough to clean a mug. I did my best to gather and share information with interested parties if I heard something worth repeating. But mostly, I was just a young witch afraid that the worst of our kind would emerge victorious.|Rosmerta talking about her experience during the [[First Wizarding War]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
By the 1973–1974 school year, Rosmerta had graduated from Hogwarts and worked as the barmaid at the [[Three Broomsticks Inn|Three Broomsticks]]  in [[Hogsmeade]], during which time the establishment would be visited by the [[Marauders]] whilst they were all still at school, and continued to do so throughout the [[First Wizarding War]]. During the conflict, the young Rosmerta, despite living in constant fear of the prospect that [[Death Eaters|the worst]] of wizardkind would emerge victorious, nevertheless played a small role in passing on useful information she overheard at the inn, though she mostly just kept her head down.<ref name="HMAROTP">{{HM|3|A RECORD OF THE PAST}} {{See video|url=https://youtu.be/LWxzhV3Px1M?t=1613}}</ref> Like most of the magical community, she also suffered personal bereavements during the first period of Voldemort’s power, as she knew some of the people who went mysteriously missing,<ref>{{HM|3|A RECORD OF THE PAST}} {{See video|url=https://youtu.be/FK_WFddshqU?t=465}}</ref> 

She also suffered adverse effects from the war herself, as she was one of the numerous witches and wizards who fell victim to what, unbeknownst to herself, were the [[Frequensting]]-[[curse]] of the [[Death Eater]] [[Antoine Grimalkin]], a which inflicted an intensifying, rhythmic stinging pain in its victim along with the echoed looping piece of music from a [[Antoine Grimalkin's cursed gramophone|cursed gramophone]], which continued to torment them and even after the sound. Rosmerta was able to deduce it was connected to the Dark Lord and his followers when, on [[1 November]] [[1981]], she and the rest of his victims, woke up to [[Fall of Lord Voldemort celebrations|the news]] of the [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1981)|Voldemort's defeat]] and [[James Potter (I)|James]] and [[Lily Potter (I)|Lily Potter]]'s deaths, and the realisation that the mysterious ailment no longer plagued them.<ref>{{HM|3|A RECORD OF THE PAST}} {{See video|url=https://youtu.be/_sKJvdNkFuQ?t=2091}}</ref>  She was later one of the many people who believed the rumours that [[Sirius Black]] had turned his friends over to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], and later that he had duelled and killed [[Peter Pettigrew]].<ref name="POA10">{{POA|B|10}}</ref> 

====Meeting Jacob's sibling====
[[File:Rosmerta Meeting Jacobs Sibling.png|250px|thumb|left|Madam Rosmerta meeting Jacob's sibling for the first time]]
She continued to tend bar during the [[1980s]]. During the [[1986–1987 school year]], Rosmerta was introduced to [[Jacob's sibling]] by [[Rubeus Hagrid]] in the [[Three Broomsticks Inn|Three Broomsticks]] during the student's first outing to [[Hogsmeade]]. They requested for information regarding [[Jacob (disambiguation)|their brother]] and his search for the [[Cursed Vaults]] from Rosmerta, in which they learnt from her recount that Jacob had [[Transfiguration|Transfigured]] [[Jacob's notebooks|a secret notebook of his]] into a Black Quill, the whereabouts of which were unknown then. Jacob's sibling beseeched Rosmerta to find it for them, promising to do anything for her in return, an offer she promptly accepted.<ref name="HM33"/>

While Rosmerta was preoccupied in searching for the Black Quill in the pub's back room, Jacob's sibling proceeded to help her out by serving her customers their orders, an activity they found moderatly easy, with the exception of them having nearly dropped a mug of [[Butterbeer]] that was Tranfigured into a mongoose by the timely intervention of a helpful wizard. 

Acknowledging that her search for the desired quill would take longer, Rosmerta requested that Jacob's sibling help her concoct an extra-sweet brew of Butterbeer by fetching its various ingredients from the [[Hogwarts Castle]] for her. By the time they had managed to fulfil her request and returned to the Three Broomsticks, Rosmerta had managed to successfully retrieve the Black Quill, which she then gave to Jacob's sibling.<ref name="HM33">{{HM|3|3}}</ref> Later during the year, she retrieved some vintage Butterbeer 1707 for [[Bilton Bilmes]] upon [[Jacob's sibling]]'s request from the back rooms of the inn, while they managed the customers for her.<ref name="HM36">{{HM|3|6}}</ref>

====1980s====
Rosmerta was interrogated by [[Patricia Rakepick]] regarding the possible whereabouts of [[Jacob (Hogwarts expellee)|Jacob]]'s notebook and map. She claimed to know nothing and threatened to inform some of her best customers from the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] regarding Rakepick's behaviour, which made the Curse-Breaker back down quickly. Rosmerta than sarcastically gave her farewell and told her not to return to her establishment again.<ref name="HM412">{{HM|4|12}}</ref>

{{Quote|Madam Rosmerta only lets me use plastic glasses after breaking her fifteenth glass mug.|[[Nymphadora Tonks]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
Towards the end of this school year, Rosmerta was present at a [[Party at the Three Broomsticks Inn|party]] held at the inn by various Hogwarts staff and students, which the [[Weird Sisters]] also performed at.<ref name="HM644">{{HM|6|44}}</ref>

During this school year, Rosmerta gave Jacob's sibling and [[Nymphadora Tonks]] the permission to use her fireplace in the inn to access the [[British Ministry of Magic]] via the [[Floo Network]].<ref name="HM74">{{HM|7|4}}</ref> Much later, she served Jacob's sibling and their father [[Peregrine]] when the two came to the Three Broomsticks for a personal dinner. However, she ended up dropping the two mugs of Butterbeer Peregrine ordered when he told her to stop listening in on their private conversation.<ref name="HM743">{{HM|7|43}}</ref>

====1993-1994 school year====
[[File:Rosmerta, Fudge and McGonagall.jpg|250px|thumb|Rosmerta, Cornelius Fudge, and Minerva McGonagall meeting outside her pub]]
In the [[1993–1994 school year]], Madam Rosmerta was angered when [[Dementor]]s were in Hogsmeade to catch Sirius Black because their presence was scaring away many of her customers, not least when they searched her pub twice. She hosted an informal meeting between [[Minerva McGonagall]], [[Cornelius Fudge]], [[Filius Flitwick]], and [[Rubeus Hagrid]] discussing Sirius Black and his friends. They discussed how Sirius Black had been named Harry Potter's godfather before the Potters' demise.<ref name="POA10">{{POA|B|10}}</ref>

===Second Wizarding War===
{{Quote|There's one thing you should know before the Ministry gets here, though. Madam Rosmerta's under the Imperius Curse, she was helping Malfoy and the Death Eaters, that's how the necklace and the poisoned mead —|Harry regarding Rosmerta being under the [[Imperius Curse]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Prisoner-of-azkaban-rosmerta.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Rosmerta talking with Fudge and McGonagall]]
In 1997, it emerged that Rosmerta had become an unwilling agent of the [[Death Eaters]]. In order to fulfil his mission to assassinate Albus Dumbledore, [[Draco Malfoy]] had managed to place Rosmerta under the [[Imperius Curse]] He used her to pass on a [[curse]]d [[Opal Necklace]] to Hogwarts student [[Katie Bell]] with the Imperius Curse,<ref name="HBP27"/>  who accidentally touched the necklace and was subjected to the very harmful curse intended for the Headmaster, nearly killing her.<ref name="HBP12">{{HBP|B|12}}</ref>

Rosmerta also [[poison]]ed [[mead]] that was intended to be given to Dumbledore through [[Horace Slughorn]] in the guise as a Christmas present, but it was unintentionally drunk by [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], who was saved by Harry Potter; Harry had shoved a [[Bezoar]] down Ron's throat to save his life.<ref name="HBP18">{{HBP|B|18}}</ref> Malfoy communicated with Rosmerta through fake [[Wizarding currency|galleons]], copying the idea from 'the [[Mudblood]] [[Hermione Granger|Granger]]' and [[Dumbledore's Army]].<ref name="HBP27">{{HBP|B|27}}</ref> [[Argus Filch]] did not suspect anything provided by Rosmerta, hence allowing the poisoned mead to sneak past security.<ref name="HBP27"/>

After Harry and Dumbledore had been to [[the Cave|the cave]] to retrieve a [[Slytherin's Locket|locket]], they believed to be one of [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s [[Horcrux]]es, they [[Apparition|Apparated]] to [[Hogsmeade]], where Madam Rosmerta alerted them to the presence of the [[Dark Mark]] above the school and gave them [[Broomstick|brooms]] on which they could travel rapidly back to Hogwarts, where Draco's plan could be brought to completion.<ref name="HBP27">{{HBP|B|27}}</ref> Harry Potter eventually cleared her name, as he feared that that an investigation into Albus Dumbledore's death might link to her.<ref name="HBP29">{{HBP|B|29}}</ref>

It is unknown if Rosmerta was part of the reinforcements from Hogsmeade during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] or if she participated in the war. This battle resulted in the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]].

===2010s===
[[File:Rosmerta - MA.jpeg|200px|thumb|right|Rosmerta in the 2010s]]
Madam Rosmerta had trouble with her [[Christmas tree]] decorations vanishing yearly. In [[December]] [[2010]], a[[Tiburon Merriweather's great-grandchild|student]] helped her track the stolen baubles to a group of [[Niffler]]s, and she let them keep a few.<ref>{{MA}}, "Bye Bye Baubles"</ref> On another day, she noticed the student looking down and found out they had argued with [[Robyn Thistlethwaite]]. Rosmerta encouraged them to keep trying, saying true friends come around with time.<ref>{{MA}}, "Butterbeer Banters"</ref>

====Anti-werewolf====
In [[December]], Rosmerta caught [[Renka Rabblehauser]] putting up anti-[[werewolf]] posters in the Three Broomsticks and called them "filth". Renka insisted werewolves were dangerous, and Rosmerta accused her of wanting Ministry officials everywhere — which Renka didn't deny. [[Aberforth Dumbledore]] backed Rosmerta, causing Renka to storm off.<ref name="WW1">{{MA|WW|1}}</ref>

Later, she welcomed a [[Tiburon Merriweather's great-grandchild|student]] to the pub and recommended [[Butterbeer]] or [[pumpkin fizz]]. After the student and [[Daniel Page]] dealt with a sudden [[spider]] outbreak, she thanked them with free drinks, blaming it on [[Rubeus Hagrid]]'s pets.<ref>{{MA}}, Time-Limited Task "Go to Three Broomsticks"</ref> When the student met her again outside the pub, Rosmerta warned them about local politics, especially the werewolf debate. Though the student disagreed with the fear, she advised them to be careful what they said.<ref>{{MA}} - in free play</ref>

After a break-in to the pub, Rosmerta used [[Mending Charm]]s to repair the damage. When questioned, she reminded the student Aberforth warned them not to get involved, but said she wouldn't tell if they didn't stop.<ref name="WW2">{{MA|WW|2}}</ref>

====The Mysterious Malady====
Rosmerta noticed Professor [[Minerva McGonagall]] meeting with [[Bewildering Blooms]] owner [[Yubert Thorne]] in her pub. [[Astrid Cole]] asked Rosmerta if the two were still in the pub while pursuing Thorne alongside the student in an attempt to save Professor McGonagall from the [[Mysterious Malady]], but Rosmerta told her that they had just left together.<ref name="MAMM4">{{MA|MM|4}}</ref>

====The Calamity====
During the [[Calamity]], Rosmerta instructed a panel of [[Magizoologist]]s on a basic [[Reviving Spell|Revive Charm]], which they later worked with [[Poppy Pomfrey]] to refine. Rosmerta also greeted a [[Calamity Investigator]] working for the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] along with a slew of ecstatic pub owners when they arrived at the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]], as their efforts to enhance wizarding inns had resulted in a sharp uptick in business.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>
