'''Bartemius "Barty" Crouch Senior''' (d. [[27 May]] [[1995]])<ref name="deathdate"/><ref name="deathdate2"/> was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], the father of [[Bartemius Crouch Junior]], and an influential [[British Ministry of Magic]] official during the mid-to-late [[20th century]].

He was the Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] during the [[First Wizarding War]] and a candidate for [[Minister for Magic]]. He had a reputation for "''fighting fire with fire''", exhibiting the sort of ruthlessness and brutality against criminals that could be compared to some [[Death Eaters]] to their victims.<ref name="GoF27" />

He was cast aside after the First Wizarding War and was put in charge of [[Department of International Magical Co-operation]]. He was eventually [[Attack on Viktor Krum and Bartemius Crouch Senior|murdered]] by his Death Eater son, [[Bartemius Crouch Junior]], who despised him. He and his son were the last members of the pure-blood [[Crouch family]].<ref name="GoF36" />

==Biography==

Bartemius was born to the [[pure-blood]] [[Crouch family]]. He was trained in the [[magic]]al arts, most likely at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], and pursued a highly successful career at the [[British Ministry of Magic]].<ref name="GoF16">{{GOF|B|16}}</ref>

He was married to a "''[[Bartemius Crouch Junior's mother|wispy-looking little witch]]''" and they had a son, who was named after him, [[Bartemius Crouch Junior]]. Crouch quickly rose through the ranks of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and became the judge of the [[Council of Magical Law]] whilst heading the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]].<ref name="GoF30">{{GOF|B|30}}</ref> Crouch spent much of his life in his career and, as such, did not pay enough attention to his family, especially his son.

[[File:Bartemius trial.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Crouch presiding over [[Igor Karkaroff]]'s trial]]
During the fight against the [[Death Eaters]] in the [[First Wizarding War]], Bartemius, as Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]], spearheaded the Ministry's operations against them. Very soon after, the true depths of his implacable hatred for the Dark Side became known to all. Any advocates for moderation were swiftly sidelined and silenced as Crouch launched a massive, sweeping nationwide crusade against Voldemort and his supporters, one marked by levels of brutality, cruelty and mercilessness that were hitherto unprecedented and took even the Death Eaters by surprise. He authorised [[Auror]]s to use the [[Unforgivable Curses]] on their opponents whenever they deemed it necessary and went under the [[Curse-to-kill|principles]] of "''kill rather than capture''" and "''attack first, ask questions later''".<ref name="GoF27" /> Through his role in the judiciary, Crouch oversaw [[Trial of Igor Karkaroff|a trial]] where he had the Death Eater [[Igor Karkaroff]] set free in exchange for the names of several other Death Eaters, including [[Augustus Rookwood]].<ref name="GoF30" /><ref>This is according to the book canon. In [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|the film adaptation]], Karkaroff sold both Rookwood and Crouch's son to the Ministry in exchange for his life.</ref> He also convicted several suspected criminals to life imprisonment in [[Azkaban]], including [[Sirius Black]], who did not even receive a trial.<ref name="GoF27" /> 

He also oversaw [[Trial of Ludovic Bagman|the trial]] of [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]], but much to Crouch's fury, the [[Council of Magical Law|Council]] cleared Bagman of all charges and even applauded Ludo for his previous achievements in a [[Quidditch]] match, though it should be noted that Bagman was merely an unwitting informant rather than an actual Death Eater.<ref name="GoF30" /> Although Crouch's tactics were extremely severe, most people believed that he was doing the right thing, as there would be no way to defeat [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] otherwise. Many people predicted that Crouch would be the next [[Minister for Magic]], since [[Albus Dumbledore]] refused the position multiple times.<ref name="GoF27" />

[[File:B4C30M1 Wizengamot trial Pensieve memory.png|250px|thumb|right|Barty Snr overseeing the trial of his son and the Lestranges]]
However, after Lord Voldemort's fall, Crouch got the news that [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|his own son]] had helped drive two [[Auror]]s — [[Alice Longbottom|Alice]] and [[Frank Longbottom]] — [[Insanity|insane]] through use of the [[Cruciatus Curse]] alongside [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], [[Rodolphus Lestrange (II)|Rodolphus]], and [[Rabastan Lestrange]] whilst they were trying to learn where their master was in hiding. A [[Trial of the Lestranges and Bartemius Crouch Junior|trial]] being the closest to fatherly affection he could give, but Crouch did not act any differently despite his son being among the accused.<ref name="GoF30" /> 

[[File:Barty.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Barty Crouch Snr ignoring his sons pleas sentencing him to Azkaban]]
Ignoring his son and wife's pleas, as well as the apparently not completely certain evidence that his son was guilty in the first place (it was later stated that there was some ambiguity about whether his son had taken part in the torture or merely been in the wrong place at the wrong time), he sentenced all four Death Eaters to [[Azkaban]] for life while cruelly claiming that he had no son. His decision was met with the roaring approval of the court.<ref name="GoF30" /> In Sirius's opinion, and by all accounts, [[Trial of the Lestranges and Bartemius Crouch Junior|this court]] was nothing more than a sham trial for Crouch Snr. to express his hatred for his son and to publicly disown him in front of the entire [[Wizengamot]].<ref name="GoF27" />

===Hiding Barty Jnr {{C|1981–1994}}===
{{Quote|So old Crouch lost it all, just when he thought he had it made. One moment, a hero, poised to become the Minister for Magic... next, his son dead, his wife dead, the family name dishonoured, and [...] a big drop in popularity.|[[Sirius Black]] on what he heard about the Crouch's misfortune|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
Shortly after their son's imprisonment, the Crouch couple was permitted a deathbed visit due to Crouch's high status as a Ministry official. [[Bartemius Crouch Junior's mother|Mrs Crouch]]'s health was failing at the time due to the stress. She begged her husband to rescue their son from prison as one last favour. Crouch Snr agreed to this request out of [[love]] for her. 

The two took advantage of the deathbed visit by using [[Polyjuice Potion]] to switch Barty Junior and Mrs Crouch in case any of the prisoners were watching from their cells, with Barty Snr successfully smuggling his son out of Azkaban. Mrs Crouch died shortly afterwards, posing as her son until the end. Barty never went to retrieve her body in fear of having the breakout exposed, so he staged her [[death]] and held a quiet, private funeral with an empty grave.<ref name="GOF35">{{GOF|B|35}}</ref>

According to Crouch Jnr, his father only saved him as a favour for his wife and that Crouch Snr himself "''[[love]]d her as he never loved'' [his son]", though due to Crouch Jnr's mental instability and biased hatred for his father at the time, it is likely this take on things was not completely accurate. However, since the Crouchs' [[house-elf]] [[Winky]] was able to gain concessions for Barty Jnr through evoking the name of Barty Snr's deceased wife, it is safe to assume that he was respecting his wife's wishes in allowing her to sacrifice herself by spending her last days in a place like Azkaban for their son's sake and in risking his own position in the Ministry despite his hatred for the [[Dark Arts]] and all who practised them.<ref name="GOF35" />

Crouch took his real son home, having his house-elf Winky nurse the boy back to health. Crouch searched long and hard for methods to restrain his son from returning to Voldemort and was eventually forced to utilise the [[Imperius Curse]] to keep Barty Jnr under house arrest for twelve years, hiding him under an [[Invisibility Cloak]]. He then assigned Winky to become the boy's keeper and carer. Winky would try to persuade her elder master to reward his son for his good behaviour, despite it all being a byproduct of the subjugation.<ref name="GOF35" />

Because of the public reaction after his "son" died, with the ambiguity of the imprisonment starting to overtake the rash decision of the trial, not to mention that people were starting to take pity on Crouch Jnr for his father's neglect, Crouch Snr lost his popularity and chance to become Minister for Magic and was shunted sideways to the [[Department of International Magical Co-operation]], with [[Cornelius Fudge]] succeeding [[Millicent Bagnold]] as Minister instead.<ref name="GOF35" />

====Discovery and aftermath====
At some point while serving as Department Head, a Ministry worker named [[Bertha Jorkins]] called at the Crouch home with Ministry paperwork. Crouch was out, but Bertha secretly overheard Winky talking to Barty Crouch Jnr. She heard enough to guess that it was Crouch Jnr hiding under an Invisibility Cloak.<ref name="GOF35" />

Upon returning home, Crouch was confronted by Bertha. Crouch took drastic measures by casting an extremely powerful [[Memory Charm]] on her, which accidentally caused Bertha some brain damage, although it was not noticeable except for a new tendency of forgetfulness.<ref name="GOF35" /> Bertha went to work for [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] at the [[Department of Magical Games and Sports]].<ref name="GoF7" />

====1994 Quidditch World Cup====

Sometime later, Winky, after months of effort, convinced Crouch Snr to take her and Barty Jnr. to the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]] final, which was being held in [[England]] that year, stating that it was what his wife would have wanted.<ref name="GOF35" /> Crouch remained in his tent while Winky took Barty Jnr., hidden under an [[Invisibility Cloak]], up to the [[Top Box]].<ref name="GOF35" /> 

Winky covered her eyes for the duration of the match because she was afraid of heights.<ref name="GOF35" /> Barty Jnr., however, had awoken from the Imperius Curse and proceeded to steal [[Harry Potter]]'s [[Harry Potter's wand|wand]] from his pocket, as Harry was sitting right in front of the invisible Barty Jnr.<ref name="GoF30" /> He later used Harry's wand to cast ''[[Morsmordre]]''.<ref name="GoF9">{{GOF|B|9}}</ref>

[[File:Barty Crouch Snr after the QWC campsite riot GOFF.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Barty Crouch Snr at the [[Quidditch World Cup]] campsite after the riot]]
Crouch saw the effect the spell had — as the [[Dark Mark]] was hovering overhead — and hurried to the place where it had just been cast.<ref name="GoF9" /> It was there that he found Harry Potter, [[Ronald Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]], as well as Winky in the bushes nearby with Harry's wand.<ref name="GoF9" /> Crouch also found his invisible son on the ground, unconscious.<ref name="GOF35" /> 

After Harry's wand was determined to be the culprit, Crouch publicly dismissed Winky (ostensibly for disgracing him,<ref name="GoF9" /> but in reality for failing to supervise his son).<ref name="GoF30" /> After the witnesses to Winky's dismissal left, Crouch recast the Imperius Curse on Barty Jnr. and returned home.<ref name="GoF30" />

Meanwhile, [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had found and [[Cruciatus Curse|tortured]] Bertha Jorkins into telling him vital information about the present state of the Ministry, including the fact that Barty Jnr. was alive and still loyal to the Dark Lord.<ref name="GoF30" /> Voldemort and [[Peter Pettigrew]] travelled to the Crouch home and placed the [[Imperius Curse]] on Crouch himself, which removed the one placed on Barty Jnr.<ref name="GoF30" />

===The Triwizard Tournament===
{{Quote|Yes. After a while he began to fight the Imperius Curse just as I had done. There were periods when he knew what was happening. My master decided it was no longer safe for my father to leave the house. He forced him to send letters to the Ministry instead. He made him write and say he was ill. But Wormtail neglected his duty. He was not watchful enough. My father escaped. My master guessed that he was heading for Hogwarts. My father was going to tell Dumbledore everything, to confess. He was going to admit that he had smuggled me from Azkaban.|Barty Crouch Jnr confessing under the effects of Veritaserum|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Crouch introducing tournament.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Bartemius and Dumbledore introducing the Triwizard Tournament]]
Crouch was ordered to go to work and do all his usual jobs as if nothing had happened. This included becoming one of the judges for the [[Triwizard Tournament]], which he and his department had helped plan out. When Crouch, along with Ludo Bagman, came to Hogwarts, Crouch was unable to get as much applause as Bagman did, probably partly because he was not a very pleasant-looking man.<ref name="GOF16">{{GOF|B|16}}</ref> 

While this was happening, Crouch's son was also in Hogwarts, impersonating the scheduled [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[Professor]] [[Alastor Moody]] using [[Polyjuice Potion]] and plotting to help his master rise to power. Crouch showed no sign of surprise, exhaustion, or any emotion at all when [[Harry Potter]]'s name came from the [[Goblet of Fire]], which was a part of Voldemort's plan. Presumably due to Voldemort's influence, Crouch insisted that any person whose name came out of the Goblet had to compete in the Tournament.<ref name="GOF17">{{GOF|B|17}}</ref>

[[File:Harry-potter-goblet-of-fire-second task.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Barty Snr during the first task of the tournament, gathering the champions together]]
A short time later, however, Crouch started to [[Spell resistance|resist]] the Imperius Curse, just like his son had done during his time under Crouch's control. Voldemort, fearing that people would become suspicious, ordered him to stay home and write letters.<ref name="GOF35" /> These letters said that he was sick, resulting in his duties as a Tournament judge being primarily carried out by [[Percy Weasley]]. This brought suspicion to some people (such as [[Sirius Black]]) who knew that Barty would never take a day off work simply because of some unexplained illness,<ref name="GoF27">{{GOF|B|27}}</ref> but no investigation was made.

===Death===
{{Quote|Don't ... leave ... me! I ... escaped ... must warn ... must tell ... see [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] ... my fault ... all my fault ...

Harry Potter ...|Barty Crouch Snr desperately trying to warn Harry Potter about [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s rise to power|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Bartemius Crouch Snr dead.jpg|thumb|250x250px|A deceased Barty Crouch Snr ]]
Eventually, Crouch broke free of the curse and, due to Wormtail's neglect, managed to escape and flee towards [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] to warn [[Albus Dumbledore]] about Voldemort's plans. Exhausted and slightly mad from the effects of Voldemort's mind-controlling spells, he staggered through the [[Forbidden Forest]] onto the Hogwarts grounds, eventually coming across Harry Potter and [[Viktor Krum]]. 

Crouch's resisting of Voldemort's spells caused him to continuously talk to a nearby tree, thinking it was his assistant "[[Percy Weasley|Weatherby]]", and to think his wife and son were still alive and well, saying that his son had gained twelve [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]]. In a short sane state, Crouch begged to speak to Dumbledore, claiming that it was "all his fault" and saying that "the dark lord was rising.<ref name="GOF28">{{GOF|B|28}}</ref>

[[File:Mysterious Bone WU.png|250px|thumb|left|A Foundable of Barty's body transfigured into a bone]]

While Harry went to get Dumbledore, Barty Jnr arrived (as Alastor Moody) and [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] Krum. He then murdered his father and [[Human to bone spell|transfigured]] the corpse into a [[bone]], burying it in [[Rubeus Hagrid]]'s [[Hagrid's Garden|garden]].<ref name="GOF35" />

Barty Jnr was later captured and admitted, under the influence of [[Veritaserum]], to having murdered his father, among the other facts of the breakout and Voldemort's [[Return of Lord Voldemort|plan]].<ref name="GOF35">{{GOF|B|35}}</ref> Soon afterwards, he was subjected to the [[Dementor's Kiss]] by a [[Dementor]] which [[Cornelius Fudge]] took into Hogwarts for his own safety when he heard there was a Death Eater in the castle.<ref name="GoF36">{{GOF|B|36}}</ref>

After his son's confession, it is unknown if Crouch Snr's corpse was retrieved and [[Untransfiguration|untransfigured]], though Fudge did deem him mad and delusional from what he heard Harry describe.<ref name="GoF36" />

===Post-mortem and legacy===
Crouch's act in rescuing his son from Azkaban for his wife and Winky's sake had indirectly ensured that a path to help Voldemort return to power was sealed, which ultimately did come to pass after Crouch's death.<ref name="GOF35" /> However, as Crouch Jnr was captured after Voldemort's return, he was sentenced to the Dementor's Kiss, which permanently ended the Crouch family bloodline. After Crouch Snr disappeared as a result of his capture and subjugation by Voldemort's Imperius Curse, along with his secret murder at the hands of his son, his popularity and legacy within the [[Wizardkind|wizarding community]] and Ministry had reached its lowest level. 

This was because his warnings about Voldemort getting stronger were not taken seriously, as he was in a delusional state at the time and the wizarding community and Ministry had both already lost their trust in him due to the fact that he put his Ministry career before his own son's welfare, which at the time had resulted in him sentencing his son to life imprisonment in Azkaban.<ref name="GoF36" />

This loss of trust for Crouch along with the lack of physical evidence of Voldemort's return indirectly caused the Ministry, encouraged by [[Cornelius Fudge]] due to his paranoia and refusal to accept the Dark Lord's return, to launch a [[Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter|smear campaign]] against Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter, believing they were both lying,<ref name="GoF36" /> and proved to be one of the major factors to Voldemort eventually seizing control of the Ministry a few years after his return.<ref name="DH1">{{DH|B|1}}</ref> 

A year later, the true circumstances of Crouch's death and disappearance were likely exposed to the wizarding community after there was evidence of the Dark Lord's return when he appeared in the Ministry of Magic himself. However, this still didn't do much to improve Crouch's legacy, as the community still lost trust and respect for him due to him helping his son escape from Azkaban and consequently sealing a path for Voldemort's return, contrary to Crouch imprisoning his son earlier to protect his career. 

Even though Crouch's popularity and legacy were largely tainted with the wizarding community by then, some of Crouch's misguided policies were adopted by the Ministry when [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] succeeded Fudge as Minister for Magic, since he allowed the arrest of innocent people like [[Stanley Shunpike]] just for making boastful claims of knowing Voldemort's plans, similar to what Crouch had done throughout his career. This was one of the reasons why Harry Potter refused Scrimgeour's attempt to recruit him into the Ministry to serve as a "mascot" to raise public morale and claim that the Ministry was winning against Voldemort, despite evidence to the contrary, with Harry pointing out that Scrimgeour and the Ministry had learnt nothing from either Crouch or Fudge's mistakes.<ref name="HBP16">{{HBP|B|16}}</ref> 

Fudge's refusal to accept Voldemort's return and Scrimgeour's inability to take enough action against Voldemort both resulted in a downward spiral of corruption which ensured that Voldemort seized power in the Ministry a few years after Crouch's death, which was only undone after [[Voldemort's Last Stand|Voldemort's final defeat]] when [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] was appointed as then acting Minister for Magic.

However, while Crouch's plight did play a major role in Voldemort's rebirth and eventual rise to power in the Ministry due to them denying his return, his act in attempting to warn Dumbledore of Voldemort getting stronger and alerting Harry Potter to it before his death also inspired Dumbledore to reinstate the [[Order of the Phoenix]] to help fight against Voldemort. 

This was down to the fact that Dumbledore knew that Voldemort would eventually return to power, his empathy towards Crouch's family history, and other evidence of Voldemort's growing strength due to the surrounding disappearances of [[Bertha Jorkins]], [[Frank Bryce]], and Crouch himself. Dumbledore also realised that he could not afford to let Voldemort influence and tear apart other families the way the Crouch family had been influenced and destroyed and was able to take Crouch's claims that Voldemort was getting stronger seriously due to this and his empathy and trust for Crouch.<ref name="GoF36" />

Even others like Sirius Black and Harry Potter were able to take Crouch's claims seriously and eventually fight against Voldemort when he returned to power, despite Sirius having a huge grudge against Crouch for imprisoning him in Azkaban without a trial and Harry being shocked at some of Crouch's actions. 

This was especially important for Harry, as he was the [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|chosen one]] destined to defeat Voldemort, which he ultimately succeeded in doing after destroying all of the Dark Lord's [[Horcrux]]es. Thus in a way, despite the critical fall in popularity and trust for Crouch within the wizarding community, Crouch's actions and legacy left both a negative and positive influence on the wizarding community after Voldemort's return, as they helped shape both the Dark Lord's return to power and his ultimate defeat.

The only one who truly mourned for Crouch's demise was Winky, who was horrified when she heard of it from his son. Winky sank into further depression, her alcoholism on [[Butterbeer]] led on for years before finally ceasing (though she never truly recovered from it).<ref name="OOTP18">{{OOTP|B|18}}</ref>

Barty Snr's death led to his son being the last living heir of the Crouch family. Barty Jnr was eventually exposed, leading to him suffering the [[Dementor's Kiss]].<ref name="GoF36" /> The family thus became extinct by mid-[[1996]].

==Physical description==
[[File:Barty Crouch Snr in the Great Hall GOFF.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Bartemius Crouch Senior]]
Crouch had short grey hair with a neat parting, which was described as "''almost unnaturally straight''", and a narrow toothbrush moustache. In certain lights, such as in semi-darkness, he took on a skull-like appearance.<ref name="GoF17" />

While disguised as a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] for the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]], he wore a black suit and highly polished shoes, making him look like a Muggle businessman, to the point that Harry Potter described that even [[Vernon Dursley]] would not be able to tell the difference.<ref name="GoF7" /> Due to this first impression, Harry thought Crouch looked weird in wizarding robes.

However, Crouch's appearance suffered after Voldemort put him under the Imperius Curse. When he appeared at Hogwarts for the selection of the Triwizard Champions, Harry noted after seeing Crouch up close that he appeared ill with papery looking skin and dark shadows under his eyes, to the point that he partially agreed with the rumours that Crouch was ill until he eventually learnt the truth after Crouch Jnr was recaptured. 

After he fought the Imperius Curse and escaped from Voldemort's control, Crouch became almost unrecognisable in his final moments, sporting a weak, dishevelled, and unshaven appearance with overgrown hair and ragged clothes due to the effort of fighting the Imperius Curse and travelling for many days between his house and Hogwarts before he was murdered by his son.

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Crouch fought violence with violence, and authorised the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects. I would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark Side.|Sirius Black on Crouch's actions as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
Crouch spoke in a curt voice<ref name="GoF17">{{GOF|B|17}}</ref> and seemed to be an overly serious person in contrast to his peers and colleagues. He did not smile or wave when his name was announced during the introduction to the [[Triwizard Tournament]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], whereas [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]], [[Department of Magical Games and Sports|Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports]], waved jovially and enthusiastically, though this probably had something to do with the Imperius Curse he was under.<ref name="GoF16" /> He was known to be a strict rule-follower, someone who would not hesitate to either give his own son to the [[Dementor]]s or dismiss a highly devoted and loyal house-elf.<ref name="GoF27" />

{{Quote|If he's ever taken a day off work because of illness before this, I'll eat [[Buckbeak]].|Sirius Black on Crouch's dedication to work|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
Having devoted his entire life to eradicating the dark forces, Crouch was well known for despising the Dark Arts and those who practised them, but the methods he used were just as brutal and cruel as those he worked to prosecute. He legalised the usages of the [[Unforgivable Curses]] and went under the principles of kill rather than capture and shoot first and ask questions later. Crouch would unethically imprison many people, including [[Sirius Black]], without trials. To this end, he disregarded true justice for no good reason other than to make himself look good in the public's eyes so as to further his own career and work his way up to becoming Minister for Magic. 

If anything even looked like it might damage or destroy his reputation, he would make it his first priority to remove it, even to the point of publicly disowning and imprisoning his son in order to make it clear that he had nothing to do with anyone who was even remotely suspected of being connected to the Dark Arts. He would later dismiss his devoted house-elf just for being at the wrong place at the wrong time (though the true reason was he deemed her unreliable since she had almost let his subjugated son get away). In order to make progress, he even accepted a plea bargain with Death Eater [[Igor Karkaroff]], granting him pardon in exchange for the names of other Death Eaters.

Despite his ruthlessness and apparent selfishness, he was not completely unreasonable, as he was capable of feeling true love, since he agreed to his wife's dying request of saving their son from prison, despite his high position, reputation, and general dislike for the Dark Arts, breaking the laws he was so adamant in enforcing. He was willing to listen to [[Winky]]'s persuasion to let Barty Jnr see the Quidditch World Cup for a taste of freedom and fresh air, though it did take her many months of effort to achieve this. He also honoured his promise to Karkaroff, releasing the Death Eater in exchange for turning in more criminals, as opposed to [[Alastor Moody]]'s desire to take the information and just send Karkaroff back to prison.

In this sense, he was more of a hypocrite than anyone but Sirius could have imagined. The reason he was seen as an unloving workaholic was due to him placing his public image and career over his family, having set his entire life into following rules and eradicating dark forces, and would spend little to no time on his family life. Indeed, Sirius found it extremely weird when Crouch was calling in sick, as the Barty he (and the public) knew would never miss a day of work for any simple reason such as sickness. This tough love for his family made his own son see it as neglect, leaving a negative impact on the young man's perception and choices.

Crouch's rule-abiding, ruthless, selfish, and neglectful nature, however, ultimately turned out to be his undoing, especially after losing his popularity in the wizarding world and keeping his son under the Imperius Curse for years to fulfil his wife's wish and to prevent him rejoining Voldemort's service. After Voldemort freed his son from the Imperius Curse Crouch put on him, Crouch's sanity was damaged by the Imperius Curse Voldemort put on him, leaving him in a delusional and weakened state after he managed to fight the Imperius Curse, resulting in his death at the hands of his own son. 

While he became delusional to the point that he was at times unaware of his point in time or his location and he even mistook a tree for [[Percy Weasley]], in one of his sane moments, he expressed remorse over his mistakes and attempted to warn Dumbledore by telling Harry Potter about Voldemort's rising power. This demonstrated that, in spite of his ruthlessness and hypocrisy, his ability to feel true love meant that he was still capable of realising and admitting his own faults.

==Magical abilities and skills==
Bartemius Crouch Senior was noted by [[Sirius Black]] to be a great [[Wizardkind|wizard]]. He was [[magic]]ally powerful and, because of his accomplishments and skills, he almost achieved the position of [[Minister for Magic]].
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Crouch was able to effectively use the [[Portkey Spell]], a [[charm]] used to create [[portkey]]s. Indeed, he created portkeys across five continents, which he later described as "no mean feat".<ref name="GoF7">{{GOF|B|7}}</ref> His [[Memory Charm]] was so powerful that it caused [[Bertha Jorkins]] permanent [[memory]] damage.<ref name="GOF35" /> Furthermore, he could produce a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]],<ref name="LEGOY1" /> a mark of superior [[magic]]al ability. He was also capable of casting the [[Stunning Spell]] proficiently.<ref name="GoF9" />
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Despite his loathing for the Dark Arts and those who practised them, Crouch was able to cast an [[Imperius Curse]] powerful enough that even an extremely adept caster of the spell, such as his son, could only resist after twelve years.<ref name="GOF35" /> His understanding of the Dark Arts led Crouch to [[Curse-to-kill|legalise]] the [[Unforgivable Curses]] during the [[First Wizarding War]], effectively allowing many [[Death Eaters]] to be captured and killed.<ref name="GoF27"/> [[Amos Diggory]] also implied that Crouch had at least cursory knowledge on how to cast ''[[Morsmordre]]'' when accusing him of having his servants cast that spell during the [[Quidditch World Cup]].<ref name="GoF9" />
*'''Multilingualism''': [[Ludovic Bagman]] stated in [[August]] of [[1994]] that Crouch could speak one hundred and fifty languages. The same day, [[Percy Weasley]] corrected him by boasting that Crouch could speak over two hundred, including [[Mermish]], [[Gobbledegook]], and [[Troll (language)|Troll]].<ref name="GoF7" />
*'''Indomitable willpower''': Crouch was able to shrug off the [[Imperius Curse]] cast on him by [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] himself after a much shorter span of time than the one he had cast on [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|his son]], showing that he had strong willpower. However, it should be noted that Voldemort was in a weakened form at the time, and Crouch's [[Spell resistance|resistance]] to the [[curse]] had led to him becoming [[Insanity|delirious and maddened]].<ref name="GOF35" /><ref name="GOF28">{{GOF|B|28}}</ref>

==Relationships==
===Wife and son===
{{Dialogue a-b|Barty Crouch Jnr|I'm your son! I'm your son!|Barty Crouch Snr|You are no son of mine! I have no son!|Bartemius Crouch Snr's disacknowledgment of his own son|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Barty_Crouch,_Jnr.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bartemius Crouch Junior]], his estranged son and killer]]
Bartemius did not pay enough attention to his [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|son]], until the day Crouch Jnr was caught in the company of three [[Death Eaters]] after the [[Attack on Frank and Alice Longbottom|torture]] of [[Alice Longbottom|Alice]] and [[Frank Longbottom]]. Crouch Snr gave his son little more than the courtesy of a trial, something he did not always give other suspects, and oversaw it personally. In the end, Crouch Snr simply used the trial as nothing but a sham to publicly disown his son and showed no mercy as he sent him to [[Azkaban]]. 

However, he fulfilled his [[Bartemius Crouch Junior's mother|wife's]] dying wish and smuggled their son back out, keeping him hidden at home under the [[Imperius Curse]] for several years. This, plus Crouch Snr's neglect of his son, proved to be his undoing, as Lord Voldemort learned of the whereabouts of his servant and freed him, turning the tables on Crouch Snr by Imperiusing him instead. Although Crouch eventually escaped, he was murdered by his own son when he attempted to warn [[Harry Potter]] and [[Albus Dumbledore]] of what had happened.

His son felt like Barty Snr loved his [[Bartemius Crouch Junior's mother|wife]] more than he had ever loved his son, but this was only the truth in the son's eyes and not necessarily the accurate truth. However, Barty Snr seemed to put his public image first, as, despite his son's pleas, he still sentenced him to [[Azkaban]] for life. Dumbledore claimed that there was generally some doubt as to whether Barty Jnr had been guilty or was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, but this was only Dumbledore's point of view and he may not have known all the evidence. Sirius Black also considered that the trial was just an excuse for Senior to show the world how much he hated his own son as opposed to being an opportunity to prove the boy's innocence. However, his love for his wife and son allowed Barty Snr to be persuaded by her dying wish to smuggle their son out of prison in exchange for her.

All of Crouch Snr's neglect of his son and ruthlessness as a Ministry official to imprison his own son brought a negative impact on Crouch Jnr's psyche, leading the boy to genuinely despise his father enough to kill him. Barty Jnr would later comment that Crouch Snr was disappointing as a father, that he suffered the indignity of being named after that father, and that he greatly enjoyed killing his father. Before Crouch Snr died, he blamed himself for what his son had become, as it was his neglect which led to Crouch Jnr joining forces with Voldemort and turning against his father.

===Winky===
{{Quote|I have no use for a house-elf who disobeys me. I have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master, and to her master's reputation.|Crouch's argument with Hermione, disdaining Winky in public|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:House-elf, Winky (Concept Artwork for the HP4 film).jpg|263x263px|thumb|[[Winky]], his loyal house-elf]]
[[Winky]] the [[house-elf]] was an extremely devoted servant of Barty Crouch Snr. She was very willing to help her master take care of his renegade son and even obeyed his orders to stay in the [[Quidditch World Cup]]'s top box despite her acrophobia. Her loyalty may have surpassed the mere magic-bound duty of an average house-elf, as she showed genuine affection for Barty even long after her dismissal.

Barty, in turn, entrusted Winky with the importance of guarding and caring for his son. Although he respected her to grant her requests to reward Junior for good behaviours, such as letting him go to the Quidditch World Cup (with months of persuasion), he also expected her to follow her duties without fail, regardless of her acrophobia. When she failed to restrain Barty Jnr, Barty Snr lost all his respect and trust in her and publicly dismissed her, treating her as nothing more than "''something filthy and rotten contaminating his over-shined shoes''" when she was screaming and begging for mercy at his feet. 

Winky was devastated by this dismissal, considering it a disgrace to her [[Winky's mother|mother]] and [[Winky's grandmother|grandmother]], and this devastation worsened when she heard that Crouch was murdered by his own son. Being the only one who truly mourned Crouch Snr's death, her devastation over her dismissal and Crouch's death resulted in a [[Butterbeer]] addiction which (even though it later reduced) she never fully overcame. 

===Percy Weasley===
[[File:Peciee.PNG|236x236px|thumb|left|[[Percy Weasley]], one of his colleagues and biggest admirers]]
Percy Weasley worked under Crouch for thirteen months and was absolutely obsessed with him. Indeed, Percy's brother [[Ronald Weasley|Ronald]] joked in [[August]] of [[1994]] that he should be expecting their engagement any day.<ref name="GoF5">{{GOF|B|5}}</ref> Crouch, however, either could not or simply didn’t care to remember Percy's name, frequently referring to his protege as "Weatherby". Percy's admiration of Crouch was so strong that he defended Crouch when his brothers mocked him and when Crouch sacked [[Winky]], putting his friendship with [[Hermione Granger]] under strain when she condemned Crouch's seemingly unreasonable act.

After Voldemort subjugated Crouch and forced him to write letters to declare his supposed sickness, Percy obeyed the orders via these letters unquestioningly. This eventually got him into trouble, as when Crouch escaped and was seen delirious on Hogwarts ground, the Ministry accused Percy of being irresponsible and unperceptive, claiming that he should have seen the written orders as potential forgeries and that he should have informed a superior of Crouch's questionable status.

It is unknown what Percy thought of Crouch after the man had been found insane in the [[Forbidden Forest]] and that Crouch had participated in breaking out his criminal son from Azkaban, and it is unknown how Percy reacted when learning of his death.

Crouch also indirectly proved to be a major factor for Percy's huge loyalty to the Ministry and his temporary estrangement from [[Weasley family|his own family]], especially as his twin brothers, [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]], started teasing him more and his younger brother Ron stopped trusting him after learning of Crouch's son. Additionally, the trouble Percy got into over Crouch's disappearance only made him more ambitious to the point that he accepted the post of Junior Assistant to the Minister for Magic under [[Cornelius Fudge]] without question and put his Ministry career before his own family when Voldemort returned to full power, just as Crouch had done.

===Bertha Jorkins===
Little is known of Crouch's relation toward Jorkins, although, after her disappearance, he spent some time convincing co-worker [[Ludovic Bagman]] to send someone out to look for her.<ref name="GoF7" /> Crouch's employee Percy Weasley stated that Crouch appeared to be rather fond of Bertha,<ref name="GoF5" /> though, when Bertha discovered Crouch's secret, he was forced to cast a [[Memory Charm]] on her that damaged her brain and memory permanently. While this was done to prevent Jorkins from exposing his secret, Crouch was remorseful over this act and her death, blaming himself for her fate.

===Ludo Bagman===
{{Quote|Despicable, Rookwood get him a job indeed... the day Ludo Bagman joins us will be a very sad day for the Ministry ''[...]'' |Crouch scorning Bagman|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Ludo Bagman HM.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ludovic Bagman]], his Ministry colleague]]
Barty had a rather negative relationship with [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]], who was a polar contrast in personality with Crouch himself. Crouch was serious and strictly adhered to rules, while Bagman took everything lightly and disregarded rules from time to time. 

To this end, Crouch once tried to have Bagman sentenced to Azkaban for unwittingly giving information to Death Eaters despite the circumstances and was infuriated when the entire court voted for Bagman's acquittal. Nonetheless, Crouch referred to him using the nickname "Ludo", instead of his full name "Ludovic" or the even more formal use of his surname.

===Albus Dumbledore===
[[File:600full-Albus-Dumbledore-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-photo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Albus Dumbledore]], who both disapproved and respected his actions]]
[[Albus Dumbledore]] had a mixed relationship with Crouch, as he was relatively civil with him but disapproved of his methods, especially during the First Wizarding War when Crouch was the Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] and attempted to become Minister of Magic. This disapproval was mostly because of Crouch's methods to catch Death Eaters and enemies which included using the Unforgivable Curses to torture or kill enemies, and the fact that Dumbledore disliked the use of Dementors within the Ministry. 

However, despite disapproving of Crouch's methods, Dumbledore still trusted him, as he was aware that, although Crouch was fully capable of cruelty and ruthlessness, it was for the good of the whole wizarding community of [[Great Britain|Britain]]. In addition, from his own tragic experiences with his family, it was only natural that Dumbledore was empathetic towards Crouch's family history, especially with his son. Henceforth, Dumbledore maintained a civil working relationship with him and was both suspicious and concerned over Crouch's supposed illness and disappearance after he was intercepted by his son and Voldemort. 

It was this trust and empathy which allowed Dumbledore to believe and take Crouch's claims seriously that Voldemort was slowly regaining power along with other evidence presented to him at the time when other members of the wizarding community, including most Ministry officials, had lost trust in Crouch due to his family history. Crouch in turn also placed great trust and respect in Dumbledore, as Dumbledore was the only person whom he decided to approach regarding his family history and Voldemort getting stronger after fighting Voldemort's Imperius Curse, despite being in a delusional state at the time, although he was killed before he could do so. 

As a result, Crouch proved to be one of the major factors to Dumbledore reinstating the [[Order of the Phoenix]] in order to fight against Voldemort after he regained power, realising that other families could not afford to be torn apart and destroyed through Voldemort's influence the way the Crouch family was, especially after Crouch's son was sentenced to the Dementors Kiss after his recapture. Despite his mixed relationship with Crouch, he was utterly disgusted when he learned of Crouch's death at the hands of his own son and Crouch Jnr's callousness. Despite his disgust of Crouch Jnr's actions, Dumbledore was disappointed with Fudge's decision to sentence Crouch Jnr to the Dementors Kiss, as it meant that Voldemort's return could no longer be testified and that the Crouch family line was permanently ended.

===Cornelius Fudge===
{{Quote|I see two possibilities, Alastor. Either Crouch has finally cracked - more than likely, I'm sure you'll agree, given his personal history - lost his mind, and gone wandering off somewhere -|Fudge being dismissive of Crouch's disappearance|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Corneliushogwarts.jpg|thumb|[[Cornelius Fudge]], his political rival]]
[[Cornelius Fudge]] held an intense hatred for Barty. This was because of Barty being one of his main competitors during the election for Minister of Magic in [[1990]], where he was jealous of how much Crouch was admired in the Ministry. Despite winning, the election left Fudge with such a strong dislike of Crouch that Fudge's very first act as Minister of Magic was to have Barty reassigned to the [[Department of International Magical Co-operation]], using Crouch's falling popularity after Crouch's son's trial to his advantage. 

Fudge's dislike of Crouch was strong to the point where he refused to take Crouch seriously. When Crouch vanished after trying to warn Dumbledore about his son and Voldemort despite being in a delusional state, Fudge simply dismissed his warnings as the ramblings of a lunatic<ref name="GOF29">{{GOF|B|29}}</ref> and refused to believe the real reason he was gone until he was forced to acknowledge Voldemort's return the following year. 

This dislike also extended to Crouch's son, as he believed Crouch Jnr was not a true Death Eater and that he only acted through [[insanity]] rather than his loyalty to Voldemort, classing him as a lunatic just like his father, and had no regret about Crouch Jnr receiving the Dementors Kiss and therefore ending the Crouch family line, even though Crouch Jnr could no longer testify regarding Voldemort's return as a result. 

Despite his dislike of Crouch Snr, Fudge apparently required Crouch for translating foreign wizards and creatures who didn't understand English, as he struggled to communicate with the [[Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] [[Oblansk|Minister of Magic]] (who was pretending to not understand English in order to prank Fudge) during the Quidditch World Cup while Crouch was absent. It is unknown what Crouch thought of Fudge, although, given his serious and rule abiding nature, he likely disliked Fudge in turn for his bumbling and incompetent nature and for reassigning him to the Department of International Magical Co-operation, which permanently ruined any further chances of Crouch becoming Minister of Magic.

===Harry Potter===
[[File:GOF_promo_front_Harry_Potter.jpg|thumb|left|[[Harry Potter]], who disliked his actions]]
[[Harry Potter]] had a somewhat mixed relationship with Crouch, initially respecting him due to his position in the Ministry and due to him being one of the Triwizard Tournament judges and organisers, and appeared more tolerant of Crouch than his friends. However, he gradually lost respect for Crouch after witnessing his treatment of Winky, after learning he imprisoned Harry's godfather, Sirius Black, without a trial, and when he learnt about his son Crouch Jnr. 

They also briefly came to blows when Crouch attacked him, Hermione, and Ron and accused them of casting the Dark Mark before discovering his son did it. When he saw Crouch up close after his name was selected from the Goblet of Fire, Harry noted that Crouch appeared ill, unaware that he was under Voldemort's Imperius Curse, and partially agreed with the rumours and reports that Crouch was ill, although he was suspicious over the time Crouch was off work and his apparent appearance in [[Severus Snape]]'s [[Potions Master's office|office]] (which was actually his son disguised as Alastor Moody). 

Crouch also appeared indifferent and mildly surprised by Harry's name appearing out of the Goblet of Fire, stating that, while it was unexpected, he and the other Hogwarts staff members should just stick to the rules and allow Harry to participate in the Tournament as Harry had entered a binding, unbreakable magical contract despite Harry being underage and not putting in his own name in the first place. Crouch also gave Harry a high score during the first task of the Triwizard Tournament, being impressed at the skills Harry displayed despite his relative indifference towards Harry's position in the Tournament. 

Harry was notably the last person Crouch spoke to before his death, even though he was in a delusional state at the time due to fighting Voldemort's Imperius Curse, with Crouch in one of his sane moments expressing remorse over his mistakes and begging Harry to warn Dumbledore that Voldemort was getting stronger, although Harry was irritated by Crouch's repeated attempts to warn him by physically grabbing him. Regardless of Harry having lost much of his respect for Crouch, however, he was still somewhat concerned when he disappeared and expressed nothing but utter shock and disgust after learning about Crouch's death at the hands of his own son, although Crouch's information about Voldemort ensured that he would fight against him after Voldemort returned to power. 

After his death, Crouch was indirectly one of the reasons why Harry refused [[Rufus Scrimgeour]]'s attempt to recruit him into the Ministry of Magic as a mascot to raise public morale, citing that Scrimgeour was making the same mistakes as Crouch by arresting and imprisoning innocent people like [[Stanley Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]]. After Alastor Moody was killed by Voldemort, Harry again referenced Crouch after they were unable to locate Moody's body, suggesting that the Death Eaters transfigured Moody's body and disposed of it in their own way, similar to how Crouch's body was transfigured and buried near [[Hagrid's Hut]].

===Hermione Granger===
[[File:Hermione Granger OOTP profile.jpg|thumb|[[Hermione Granger]], who strongly disliked his authoritarian attitudes]]
[[Hermione Granger]] initially respected Barty for being rule-abiding. This respect was destroyed when she saw that he sent Winky to the Top Box despite her acrophobia, and this was further complicated when Crouch attacked Hermione, Harry, and Ron and accused them of casting the Dark Mark before discovering it was his son. When he dismissed Winky despite knowing she didn't conjure the Dark Mark, Hermione was absolutely disgusted and lashed out at Crouch in Winky's defence, although Crouch coldly responded that he had no use for a house elf who disobeyed him. This disgust increased when she learned about Barty Snr imprisoning Sirius Black in Azkaban without a trial and about how he gave Barty Crouch Jnr to the Dementors.

When Harry told her about how he kept saying stuff was his fault and mentioned his son, she simply stated "Well that was his fault." It is unknown how she reacted after learning how Crouch had helped his son escape from Azkaban, learning that the true reason he sacked Winky was due to her failure to prevent Barty Crouch Jnr from casting the Dark Mark, and his murder at the hands of his own son. However, two years after Crouch Snr's death, Hermione was visibly horrified when Harry brought up the transfiguration of Crouch Snr's body when they were discussing the manner of [[Alastor Moody]]'s death and the disappearance of his body, showing that, although she severely disliked Crouch, she didn't actually hate him either and found the idea of such a cruel way of disposal undeserving even for him.

===Ron Weasley===
[[File:OOTP promo front Ron cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Ron Weasley, who had little respect for him]]
Unlike his friends and older brother Percy, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] did not have much respect for Crouch since his brother would not stop pestering him constantly about him and because of Crouch's strict rule-abiding policy and lack of humour, as Ron was a polar opposite of Crouch. Due to this, Ron once made a sarcastic remark that Percy and Crouch would one day announce their engagement and stated that he would rather work for Ludo Bagman rather than Crouch, as Bagman was more humorous and less strict.

Despite not having as much respect for Crouch as his friends, Ron was more defensive of Crouch compared to Hermione and even Harry in regard to Crouch's treatment of [[Winky]]. This was due to Ron's pragmatic nature, as he acknowledged the fact that Winky was happy working for Crouch and liked being told what to do by him to the point where she held a seat for him despite her acrophobia and that this was because she wasn’t human and as such didn’t think like one, even claiming that Hermione didn't like Crouch just because of Winky. 

When he, Harry, and Hermione were present when the Dark Mark was cast by Crouch's son, Crouch attacked them and accused them of casting the Dark Mark before discovering his son did it, with Ron demanding Crouch why he attacked them. However, when Sirius revealed that Crouch imprisoned him in Azkaban without a trial and what he had done to Barty Crouch Jnr, Ron was horrified to the point where he began referring to such actions as "doing a Crouch" and stopped trusting Percy as a result. This eventually resulted in the brothers' estranged relationship when Percy disowned his family due to his loyalty to the Ministry until they reconciled after the [[Second Wizarding War]] ended.

===Sirius Black===
{{Quote|Nasty little shock for old Barty, I'd imagine. Should have spent a bit more time at home with his family, shouldn't he? Ought to have left the office early once in a while... gotten to know his own son.|Sirius Black denouncing Barty Crouch Senior|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Sirius-Black-Wallpaper-sirius-black-32913977-1024-768.jpg|thumb|Sirius Black, who resented and despised him]]
[[Sirius Black]] had a strong grudge and hatred against Barty. This was mostly because Crouch was the one responsible for sentencing him to a life imprisonment in Azkaban without a trial, denying him the opportunity to appeal his frame-up, and because of his disgust about Barty Crouch Jnr.<ref name="GoF27"/> However, his hatred of Crouch didn't stop Sirius from taking Crouch seriously, for when Harry told him about Crouch's ramblings and him vanishing afterwards, he instantly realised that Crouch was trying to warn Dumbledore and that the reason he vanished was because someone wanted to stop him from seeing Dumbledore. 

He also was knowledgeable of Crouch's tactics to catch Death Eaters and other enemies while he was Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including using the Unforgivable Curses against them. Sirius stated that despite his disdain towards him, Crouch's principles may have been right to start off with, as they were fellow opponents against Voldemort at the time, although he also said that Crouch became just as cruel and ruthless as the forces he was fighting against. 

Sirius also knew Crouch's demeanour well enough to be suspicious over Crouch's disappearance and the rumours of Crouch's illness, knowing that Crouch would never miss a day of work for any simple reason such as sickness. Even after Crouch's death, Sirius was still resentful of Crouch's decision to sentence him in Azkaban without a trial, commenting that he was unsure he would accept an apology from the Ministry of Magic even if they acknowledged Voldemort's return.

===Amos Diggory===
[[File:Jeff_Rawle_as_Amos_Diggory_(GoF-promo-03).jpg|thumb|left|[[Amos Diggory]], his colleague]]
Not much is known about Crouch's relationship with [[Amos Diggory]], but it obviously happened to be a rather strict one. When Amos thought Crouch's house-elf Winky had conjured the Dark Mark, Crouch was offended by this and reprimanded Amos, especially since Crouch had proved and demonstrated throughout his long career that he detested and despised the Dark Arts and those who practised them.

===Arthur Weasley===
[[File:Arthur Weasley profile.jpg|thumb|[[Arthur Weasley]], his colleague]]
Not much is known about Crouch's relationship with [[Arthur Weasley]], but it seemed they must have been on somewhat civil terms, as Crouch was polite to him.

===Wizarding community===
During the [[First Wizarding War]], Crouch was the Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] and he fought violence with violence. He authorised [[Auror]]s to usage of the [[Unforgivable Curses]], to kill suspects rather than capture, attack first and question later and imprisoned many without trials. It was a time when the Death Eaters were terrorising the entire community and what Barty did was seen as the only way they could be victorious. Due to his effectiveness, he was incredibly popular, rising within the Ministry to the point he almost secured the post of [[Minister for Magic]]. 

Even when he sentenced his own son to life in prison, the community cheered him on for giving the impression of progress. [[Sirius Black]], on the other hand, held a personal grudge against Crouch for sentencing him to [[Azkaban]] without a trial, losing an opportunity to appeal to the frame-up he had been caught up in. Crouch also attracted political opposition from [[Cornelius Fudge]], who was his rival for the Minister for Magic post and was jealous of Crouch's popularity.

However, after Voldemort's first downfall and sometime after Barty's son was labelled deceased in prison, his popularity within the community dropped critically, as citizens and colleagues alike were able to calm down from their savage approvals after the terror ended and accused Crouch for being too neglectful as a father and was the reason his own son managed to fall so low. As such, Crouch's declining reputation led him to be reassigned to the [[Department of International Magical Co-operation]] once Fudge became the new Minister for Magic.

By the [[1994–1995 school year]], Barty Crouch received much less applause from the students than [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]], mostly due to his appearance of a strict rule-follower, as opposed to the more cheerful Bagman. After Winky failed to prevent his son from firing the [[Dark Mark]] into the sky during the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]] and was found at the scene of the crime, along with his reputation being nearly tarnished due to his connections with the elf, he publicly fired her, causing Hermione Granger to lash out at him with disgust for his seemingly unreasonable firing of Winky. Ron Weasley, who had the least respect for Crouch among his friends, also fully lost his respect for Crouch when he learned about Barty Crouch Jnr and stopped trusting his older brother Percy as a result. 

Harry Potter, who was more tolerant of Crouch than his friends, also lost respect for Crouch due to these reasons and when he learnt about Crouch imprisoning Sirius Black, who was his godfather. Near the end of his life, Barty's mental stability was damaged from Voldemort's subjugation, and the Ministry simply classified him as insane and refused to believe the true circumstances of Crouch's disappearance and death until there was evidence of Voldemort's return the following year, showing how much Crouch's status had fallen within the society's standing.

While he disapproved of some of Crouch's methods to catch Death Eaters along with his use of Dementors in the Ministry, Dumbledore was one of the few people who maintained trust in Crouch after his popularity in the wizarding community fell, as he believed Crouch's claims that Voldemort was gradually regaining his former strength and eventually used that as a platform to reform the Order of the Phoenix to fight against Voldemort after he regained power. 

It is unknown how the wizarding community reacted when learning of Crouch's secret and his death after there was evidence of Voldemort's return, although, given how much his status had already fallen due to the community accusing him of being a neglectful father, it is likely that, while the community was shocked when learning of his death, Crouch's reputation was permanently tarnished once his past came to light, especially as it was Crouch's act in rescuing his son from Azkaban which eventually caused both Voldemort's return and the Second Wizarding War. Despite this, the Ministry still did not learn any lessons from Crouch's or Fudge's mistakes once they acknowledged Voldemort's return, with some of Crouch's misguided decisions being adopted by the Ministry under [[Rufus Scrimgeour]]'s tenure as Minister for Magic, which included arresting and imprisoning innocent people like [[Stanley Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]].

==Etymology==
*The name Bartemius originates from the Biblical name Bartimaeus, who was permanently blind all his life, until Jesus healed him. Reasons for naming him after a blind man may be due to the fact that Bartemius was quite oblivious to his family, and specifically to his son.
*The surname Crouch is a variation of the [[England|English]] surname Cross. This could refer to the gibbet where criminals were executed in ancient times, this word being connected to the Latin verb ''cruciāre'', which means "to put to death on a cross", but also "to torture, torment"; and could also refer to Crouch's extreme brutality against Death Eaters, those who practise the Dark Arts, and generally speaking criminals.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Barty Crouch Sr LEGO.jpg|thumb|250px|Barty Crouch Senior as a LEGO minifigure]]
[[File:Barty Crouch Senior LEGO.png|250px|thumb|Barty Crouch Senior in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]
[[File:Bartemius Crouch Snr dead.jpg|250px|thumb|Crouch's lifeless body in the Forbidden Forest]]
*In {{GOF|FA}}, Crouch is portrayed as a somewhat more cheerful and less ruthless character and a generally more likeable man. He congratulates Harry after the latter successfully completes the Second Task, but Barty Jnr, in the guise of Moody, interrupts their heartfelt conversation, asking whether Crouch was trying to get Harry into a [[Ministry of Magic summer internship|summer internship at the Ministry]] and also alluding to the fact that the last [[Unidentified Department of Mysteries intern|intern]] who went into the [[Department of Mysteries]] was never seen again. At this point, Crouch sees Moody twitch like Barty Jnr and seems to suspect that Moody is actually his son (having apparently played no part in his escape from [[Azkaban]]). Instead of arriving in Hogwarts driven half-sane and subsequently disappearing without a trace, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid later find Crouch's dead body in the [[Forbidden Forest]].
**Also in the film, [[Albus Dumbledore]] said that it destroyed Crouch to send his son to [[Azkaban]] and he is indeed shown to be utterly crushed and emotionally devastated when his son being a Death Eater is revealed to him. In the book, however, he seemed fully willing to do it and had no qualms or regrets about it. But the truth about the accurate case on that was not revealed. Also, the film version had no mention of Crouch's nor his wife's part in their son's escape from Azkaban.
**Finally, because Winky was omitted from the film, his rather abusive treatment of her is also absent (which in turn eliminates the entire sub-plot of Hermione becoming a crusader and advocate for House Elf rights).
*In the film of ''The Goblet of Fire'', Crouch was portrayed by the late actor [[Roger Lloyd-Pack]], who was best known for his roles as {{W|Trigger (Only Fools and Horses)|Trigger}} in ''Only Fools and Horses'' and Owen Newitt in the ''Vicar of Dibley''. Lloyd-Pack also appeared in the revamped ''{{W|Doctor Who}}'' series episodes {{W|Rise of the Cybermen}} and ''Age of Steel'' along with [[David Tennant]] (who plays Barty Crouch Jnr in the ''Goblet of Fire'' film). In the latter appearance, the respective actors' roles were reversed however, with Tennant playing [[w:c:tardis:Tenth Doctor|the main hero]] and Lloyd-Pack playing [[w:c:tardis:John Lumic|a villain]]. Lloyd-Pack played John Lumic (ambitious leader of Cybus industries, formed his own version of the Cybermen) while Tennant played the Doctor.
*Crouch is one of the very few wizards able to convincingly disguise themselves in Muggle clothes. The "''impeccably crisp suit and tie''" he wore at the Quidditch World Cup were so credible "''that he could have passed for a bank manager''", and Harry doubted that even Uncle Vernon could have spotted him.<ref name="GoF7" /> Also, when Harry saw him at Hogwarts, he thought that Crouch "''looked strange in wizard’s robes''".<ref name="GoF16" />
*In the book, Crouch constantly refers to [[Percy Weasley]] as "Weatherby". This is very similar to Roger Lloyd-Pack's ''Only Fools and Horses'' character Trigger, who constantly refers to {{W|Rodney Trotter|Rodney}} as "Dave". This is not seen in the film, as Percy's role was cut.
*Due to Percy's omission, Crouch Snr took over the roles Percy had in the book of attending the [[Yule Ball]] and Second Task for the film. In the book, Crouch Snr had disappeared due to a supposed "illness", which was actually him being placed under the [[Imperius Curse]] by [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]], and had to be hidden away due to signs of Crouch Snr being able to resist it. It was through falsified letters that Percy took over the responsibilities in Mr Crouch's place for those tasks in the book.
*It is unknown if Barty Crouch attended Hogwarts and, in that case, which [[Hogwarts Houses|House]] he was [[Sorting Ceremony|Sorted]] into, but it is worth noting that he was ambitious, cunning, and determined, that he put his self-preservation above everything else, and that he was a natural-born leader. All these traits were particularly admired by [[Salazar Slytherin]] himself and pertain to [[Slytherin|his House]], which is normally connected to what Crouch Snr hated the most: the Dark Arts.
*According to his own words, [[Bartemius Crouch Senior's grandfather|his grandfather]] had an [[Axminster]] [[flying carpet]] which could seat twelve people — "''but that was before carpets were banned, of course''".<ref name="GoF7" />
*He was one of the few pure-blood wizards who did not care about continuing the blood line. He himself sentenced a life imprisonment in Azkaban to his only son without hesitating, which generally means a conviction worse than death.<ref>In {{GOF}}, Chapter 36 (''The Parting of the Ways''), Albus Dumbledore states that Barty Crouch Jnr was the last remaining member of the Crouch family.</ref>
*By dismissing Winky, Crouch effectively doomed himself to Voldemort's subjugation, as this prevented her from saving him or reporting to the Ministry for help.
