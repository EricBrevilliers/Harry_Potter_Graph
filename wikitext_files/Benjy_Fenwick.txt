{{Quote|Benjy Fenwick, he copped it too, we only ever found bits of him…|Benjy's gruesome death|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}'''Benjy Fenwick''' (d. [[1981]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and member of the original [[Order of the Phoenix]]. He fought in the [[First Wizarding War]] and was murdered and mutilated by [[Death Eaters]] before the war's end.<ref name="OOTP9"/>

==Biography==
Though nothing is known about his early life, it is likely that as a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], he attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] when he turned eleven and that he had graduated prior to [[1981]] as the First Wizarding War ended that year.

[[File:Order of the Phoenix.png|left|thumb|250px|The original [[Order of the Phoenix]]]]
During the [[First Wizarding War]], Fenwick became a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], an organisation founded and led by [[Albus Dumbledore]], in order to oppose the evil [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]]. Fenwick most likely fought in several battles of the [[First Wizarding War]].

Fenwick was brutally murdered by Death Eaters during the war. On the day of his [[death]], a Death Eater presumably fired a deadly [[curse]] at Fenwick that blasted him into pieces (possibly the [[Blasting Curse]]). The Death Eater then disposed of his remains. According to fellow Order member [[Alastor Moody]], in their search for Fenwick's body they only ever found ''"bits of him."''<ref name="OOTP9">{{OOTP|B|9}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*On {{PM}}, an image of Benjy has him being of a tanned skin colour but whether this is [[canon]] to the series is unknown - the image also has [[Alice Longbottom]] as having brown hair when, as her son resembles her, she is most likely (formerly) blonde so there are potential errors or differences between sources.
