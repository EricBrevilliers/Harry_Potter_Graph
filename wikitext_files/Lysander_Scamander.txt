When his mother travelled to the [[Patagonian Desert]], in [[Argentina]], to attend the final of the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup|427th Quidditch World Cup]], in [[July]] [[2014]], Lysander was left at home with his grandfather, along with [[Lorcan Scamander|Lorcan]].<ref name="dumbledores-army-reunites" />

==Etymology==
*Lysander means "liberator of mankind" or simply "liberator" in Greek.
*Lysander is the name of a principal character in {{W|William Shakespeare}}'s ''{{W|A Midsummer Night's Dream}}''. The play takes place largely at night, ''"lit by moonlight"'' as Oberon states; which hearkens back to Lysander's mother, Luna.
