'''Ambrosius Flume''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who, by the [[1990s]], ran [[Honeydukes|Honeydukes Sweetshop]] in [[Hogsmeade]], a very popular shop among Hogwarts students during the [[Hogsmeade weekend trips|school's weekend trips]] to the village, with [[Ambrosius Flume's wife|his wife]].

==Biography==
===Early life and employment===
Ambrosius Flume attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]] in his youth and was taught [[Potions (class)|Potions]] by [[Horace Slughorn]]. Ambrosius became a member of the [[Slug Club]].<ref name="HBP4">{{HBP|B|4}}</ref>

As he was a member of the [[Slug Club]], [[Horace Slughorn]] introduced Ambrosius to [[Ciceron Harkiss]] and thus had him employed. As repayment for Horace's kindness, Flume sent a hamper of Slughorn's favourite sweets ([[Crystallised Pineapple|Crystallised pineapple]]) to him annually on his birthday.<ref name="HBP4"/>

At some point in his life, Ambrosius married [[Ambrosius Flume's wife|Mrs Flume]].<ref name="HBP4"/> By [[1993]], the couple lived in a flat above [[Honeydukes|Honeydukes Sweetshop]] and together ran said shop. As the proprietor of Honeydukes, Ambrosius was often involved in the various events and activities around Hogsmeade and Hogwarts.

===1980s===
During the [[1986–1987 school year]], Ambrosius organised a scavenger hunt and confectionary feast at Hogwarts. All the students that managed to decipher the clues to find a [[Chocolate Frog Card]] were able to attend. Some of the clues led to the Chocolate Frog Cards for [[Cliodna]], [[Roderick Plumpton]], [[Circe]], and [[Celestina Warbeck]]. [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Merula Snyde]] both managed to get into the feast using the same card, as they claimed Ambrosius never said whether or not students had to have different cards.<ref name="Clues">{{HM|3|FLUME'S CLUES}}</ref>

During the [[1987–1988 school year]] Ambrosius set a stall at the [[Hogsmeade Festival]] to sell sweets, however his stall was destroyed along with the rest of the festival by [[Ismelda Murk]] when she trashed the festival in revenge against her [[Annalena Gleam|sister]]. He later chipped in to give [[Jacob's sibling]] a [[miniature fireworks display]] as thanks for them saving the festival.<ref name="HM4HF">{{HM|4|Hogsmeade Festival}}</ref>

Also during that year, Jacob's sibling and [[Penny Haywood]] came into his store asking about [[Horace Slughorn]], except the store was so busy that they couldn't talk to him. However when Ambrosius noticed that someone had stolen his last box of [[Pepper Imps]], Jacob's sibling apprehended the thief, and out of gratitude Ambrosius told them that he had recently been sending boxes of his [[Crystallised Pineapple]] to [[Bathilda Bagshot's Home]] in [[Godric's Hollow]]. He later joined the reunion dinner that Slughorn held in the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]].<ref name="JSC">{{HM|4|Joining the Slug Club}}</ref>

===1990s===
During the [[1990–1991 school year]], Ambrosius fell under the spell of [[Todd Cribb]] who was masquerading as a [[vampire]] named 'The Count'. He was freed from the spell by [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Barnaby Lee]], and then helped Barnaby free the other townsfolk whilst Jacob's sibling confronted Todd.<ref name="HMTVOH">{{HM|7|THE VAMPIRE OF HOGSMEADE}}</ref>

In [[1993]], during one of the weekend trips to Hogsmeade, [[Ambrosius Flume's wife|Mrs Flume]] asked Ambrosius to get some [[Jelly Slug]]s, as the shop was filled with Hogwarts students.<ref name="PA10">{{POA|B|10}}</ref>

On [[2 May]] [[1998]], it is most likely that, as a former Hogwarts student, Ambrosius participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] alongside his [[Ambrosius Flume's wife|wife]], and fellow [[Hogsmeade]] residents [[Aberforth Dumbledore]], [[Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]] and [[Puddifoot|Madam Puddifoot]].

===2010s===
In December [[2010]], Ambrosius was in Honeydukes when a thief on a spree of break-ins in the village entered and hit him on the head. He was left with a nasty bump and his shop and its products were trampled on.<ref name="WW">{{MA|WW|2}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Ambrosius'' comes from the Greek word "ambrosia" meaning food or drink of the deities. It is also referred as nectar, which is sweet and bestows immortality. A flume is an artificial channel for the flow of [[water]].

==Behind the scenes==
*Flume may have been the one who told [[Tom Riddle]] that [[Horace Slughorn]] was quite fond of [[Crystallised Pineapple]]. Tom used this sweet as a casual bribe the night he asked Slughorn on the method and effects of creating [[Horcrux]]es.
*It is possible, as he was a former [[Slug Club]] member, that he attended the [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]] in [[1996]].
*In {{HBP|FA}}, Ambrosius only appears in a flashback on disc 2 from {{POA|FA}} and is mentioned on the original script.<ref>[http://www.imsdb.com/Movie%20Scripts/Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Half-Blood%20Prince%20Script.html ''Half-Blood Prince'' script] on the Internet Movie Script Database (archived [http://web.archive.org/web/20110101193134/http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince.html here])</ref>
**Also in the novel, Slughorn said that Ambrosius sent a hamper of his favourite sweets, which were [[Crystallised Pineapple]], every birthday, while on the original script from the film Slughorn said that Ambrosius sent him a hamper of chocolate each birthday. This is possibly why it was cut from the film, as it contradicts the novel and would totally ruin later events, such as Slughorn's memory about the [[Slug Club]] dinner with [[Tom Riddle]], in which Tom gave Slughorn crystallised pineapple.
