==Biography==
<!-- don't put things that are barely known to be facts, it doesn't add info that isn't already more or less stated elsewhere within the article -->
===Hogwarts years {{C|1989-1996}}===
====Early years====
Alicia Spinnet attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1989]] to [[1996]], and was sorted into [[Gryffindor]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]]. There, she became friends with fellow Gryffindors [[Katie Bell]], [[Angelina Johnson]], [[Lee Jordan]], [[Oliver Wood]], and the twins [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] who all shared an interest in [[Quidditch]].

Alicia tried out for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] and made reserve position; according to a comment by [[Lee Jordan]], she was a good pick by Oliver, meaning she had an impressive skill at Quidditch but still only made reserve.

====Third year====
{{Quote|...a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve —|Alicia officially joining the team|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Gryffindor team.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Alicia standing with the rest of the Gryffindor team before a Quidditch game]]

Alicia was only a reserve on the [[Gryffindor]] [[Quidditch]] [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|team]] until 1991, her third year, when she would become a Chaser. Alicia was most often the [[Chaser]] who attempted penalty shots for [[Gryffindor]] when the other team committed a foul. In 1991, a new [[Seeker]], [[Harry Potter]], joined the team. Alicia became friendly with Harry, too. The Gryffindor Quidditch team won two times during this year,<ref name="PS11">{{PS|B|11}}</ref> but was [[Gryffindor vs Ravenclaw Quidditch match (1992)|defeated]] by [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team|Ravenclaw]], costing them their chance at the title. However, [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]] would have had the most points by the end of the year, due to Harry Potter, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Neville Longbottom]] because of their actions the previous night.<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref>

====Fourth year====
{{Quote|Oliver, this is mad, you can't let Harry deal with that thing on his own. Let's ask for an inquiry —|Alicia suggest they stop the game|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Harry-potter2-movie-gryffindor team.jpg|250px|thumb|Alicia is present when Draco Malfoy calls Hermione Granger a "''filthy little Mudblood''"]]

Alicia found prejudice based on [[Blood status|blood purity]] extremely offensive, screaming "how dare you" when [[Draco Malfoy]] called [[Hermione Granger]] a "[[Mudblood]]" in 1992.<ref name="COS7">{{COS|B|7}}</ref> 

However, the team had time to [[[[Gryffindor vs Slytherin Quidditch match (1992)|play]] against Slytherin; during the game, a [[Rogue Bludger]] chased Harry in an unusual way. Alicia was afraid that the Bludger would kill Harry as it was very violent, and told Oliver Wood, the Captain, that they should ask to forfeit the match.<ref name="COS10">{{COS|B|10}}</ref>

[[File:1992 Duelling Club.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Katie, Angelina, and Alicia at the only meeting of the Duelling club after catching Lockhart's cloak]]

During this year, she also was a member of the Duelling Club and she attended the first meeting with Katie and Angelina. At the [[Duelling Club]], the three of them fought for Gilderoy Lockhart's cloak that he tossed into the crowd before duelling with Snape. Later during the club meeting she witnessed Harry Potter speak [[Parseltongue]] in order to save a fellow student from a snake that Draco Malfoy conjured during his practice duel with him. It is unknown if she was one of the many students who thought that Harry himself was the Heir of Slytherin.<ref name="COS11">{{COS|B|11}}</ref>

====Fifth year====
[[File:Gryffindor common room 1993.jpg|250px|thumb|Professor McGonagall and the residents of Gryffindor Tower in the common room after Sirius Black's break-in]]

In Alicia's fifth year, [[Oliver Wood|Wood]] became more competitive, as [[Gryffindor]] had not won the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]] in over seven years and he wanted to break the losing streak. During practice, Wood commented on his chasers playing "superbly".<ref name="POA8">{{POA|B|8}}</ref> Gryffindor had originally planned to play [[Slytherin]] first, but due to Draco's injury, they faced the [[Hufflepuff Quidditch team|Hufflepuff team]] instead, captained by [[Cedric Diggory]]. When Wood spoke of the [[Hufflepuff]] Captain Cedric, [[Katie Bell|Katie]], [[Angelina Johnson|Angelina]], and Alicia started giggling and commented on Cedric's good looks. The [[Gryffindor vs Hufflepuff Quidditch match (1993)|game]] itself did not go too well, as the players struggled against the terrible weather, with Alicia's broomstick catching on fire, and [[Harry Potter|Harry]], Gryffindor's [[Seeker]], had passed out in the presence of a [[Dementor]] and fell from his broom, leaving Cedric to catch the Snitch and Gryffindor to lose the match. Alicia was also present the night that [[Sirius Black]] successfully broke into Gryffindor Tower.<ref name="POA9">{{POA|B|9}}</ref>

[[File:B3C15M2 Harry Holding Quidditch Cup in a Crowd.png|250px|thumb|left|Gryffindor wins the Quidditch Cup in 1994]]
Alicia and her team later played [[Ravenclaw]]. Gryffindor were up by eighty points when Ravenclaw started to make a comeback, but Harry caught the [[Golden Snitch|Snitch]]. The final match of the season was against Slytherin and the match was loaded with brutal play. Alicia scored the first penalty of the match after Angelina was assaulted by Marcus Flint and was herself subjected to an assault when the Slytherin Beater Bole struck her with his club claiming that he thought she was a Bludger, prompting George Weasley to elbow Bole in the face for attacking her. After Draco Malfoy fouled Harry by grabbing his broom to slow it down, Gryffindor was awarded another penalty that Alicia took, but she was so angry at the foul that she missed by several feet. Gryffindor won the match and the Quidditch Cup something that hadn't been achieved since [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]] played on the team.<ref name="POA15">{{POA|B|15}}</ref> At the end of Alicia's fifth year, she and her fellow players would bid farewell to Wood as he graduated from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. She was also present when the Dementors were removed from school grounds.

====Sixth year====
During her sixth year, the Quidditch matches were cancelled again, due to the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. Despite being in the sixth year, it is unknown whether Alicia was old enough to enter her name into the [[Goblet of Fire]]. However, the year ended with the death of champion [[Cedric Diggory]] and the return of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]].

====Seventh year====
{{Quote|Andrew Kirke and Jack Sloper. Neither of them are brilliant, but compared to the rest of the idiots who turned up...|Alicia to Harry Potter regarding Quidditch replacements|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Dumbledore's Army in circle.JPG|250px|thumb|A Dumbledore's Army meeting]]
During her seventh and final year Alicia was captained under [[Angelina Johnson]], who replaced Oliver Wood when he left. The team's first Quidditch practice did not go very well and resulted in Katie Bell suffering great [[blood]] loss.<ref name="OOTP14">{{OOTP|B|14}}</ref> When [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor|High Inquisitor]] [[Dolores Umbridge]] inspected [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]]'s [[Charms (class)|Charms classes]], she asked her how she viewed Flitwick's skills as [[professor|teacher]], and she responded only with positive comments.<ref name="OOTP15">{{OOTP|B|15}}</ref> Disliking Umbridge, Alicia and her friends met up for the meeting at [[Hog's Head]] and would then join [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation founded by [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] and led by Harry, in order to teach [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] to the students, something that Umbridge did not.<ref name="OOTP16">{{OOTP|B|16}}</ref>

Alicia attended as many meetings as she could make without being caught by Umbridge and risking being in detention as the meetings themselves were cutting into what little Quidditch practice she had and she couldn't afford to lose her spare time. In her first meeting, where they practised the [[Disarming Charm]], Alicia was hit hard on the nose by [[Terry Boot]]'s [[wand]] when it went flying across the room.<ref name="OOTP18">{{OOTP|B|18}}</ref> 

Before a [[Gryffindor vs Slytherin Quidditch match (1995)|Quidditch match against Slytherin]], Alicia was [[Eyebrow jinx|jinxed]] by [[Miles Bletchley]] from behind in the [[Hogwarts Library]] while she worked, giving her long eyebrows which obscured her vision. This was part of Slytherin's plot to [[hex]] opposing Gryffindor players before the game. However, due to [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]'s bias against Gryffindor, he refused to listen to fourteen eye witnesses who saw Miles jinx Alicia, and insisted she had performed a [[Hair-Thickening Charm]] on herself instead. Her jinxed eyebrows were fixed by [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]]. This allowed her to play the game, winning the match for Gryffindor, with her and Angelina hugging Harry after the match. Alicia and the other players had to stop Fred Weasley from attacking [[Draco Malfoy]] following his insults towards Ron. She was also disgusted at Umbridge's Quidditch ban on Harry and Fred for attacking Draco, as [[Vincent Crabbe]] had only received lines for his [[Bludger]] foul after the match had ended.<ref name="OOTP19">{{OOTP|B|19}}</ref> 

At the last meeting before [[Christmas]] break, Alicia informed Harry that she and Angelina had found replacements for the team once they had left, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], [[Andrew Kirke]], and [[Jack Sloper]], she remarked that the latter two were not very good, but that they would have to do.<ref name="OOTP21">{{OOTP|B|21}}</ref>

===After Hogwarts {{C|1996-1998}}===
====[[Battle of Hogwarts]]====
{{Quote|Kingsley and Lupin were looking up at him, as were Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson and Alicia Spinnet, Bill and Fleur, Mr and Mrs Weasley.|Arrival of past students and Order members|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Voldemort vanquished.png|250px|thumb|left|Alicia and the other defenders of Hogwarts witness Harry Potter's final defeat of Voldemort]]

After graduating from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] it is unknown what Alicia went on to do, furthering her career in Quidditch is a possibility. But as the [[Second Wizarding War]] was at its height she carried her Dumbledore's Army coin around with her, and when the time came in 1998, [[Neville Longbottom]] summoned all past and present [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] members to return to Hogwarts to join the forces in the Battle of Hogwarts fighting against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]]. Alicia returned to Hogwarts with her friends, [[Oliver Wood]], [[Katie Bell]] and [[Angelina Johnson]] and Order of the Phoenix members they informed, [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]].<ref name="DH30">{{DH|B|30}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
Alicia was a good-natured and friendly individual who was very interested in [[Quidditch]]. She did also care about her friends, as she was afraid for [[Harry Potter]]'s life while a [[Bludger]] was chasing him. Furthermore, she strongly disliked those with [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood supremacist]] views, such as [[Draco Malfoy]], and believed that no differences exist between pure-bloods and muggle-borns, as she screamed to Malfoy ''"How dare you!"'', when he called [[Hermione Granger]] a ''"[[Mudblood]]"''.<ref name="COS7"/> A fair-minded player, she despised fouls and cheating; when Harry was fouled by Draco Malfoy, Alicia was angry enough that it caused her to miss a penalty.

She was also brave, as she was sorted at [[Gryffindor]] house, and was a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]] in order to oppose [[Dolores Umbridge]]. Furthermore, she fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in order to help defeat the Death Eaters and win the final battle, showing her to be very courageous and determined indeed.

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Quote|We've got three superb [[Chaser]]s.|[[Oliver Wood]] talking about [[Angelina Johnson]], [[Katie Bell]], and Alicia|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Alicia played the position of Chaser on the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], showing she was an excellent [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player. She often took the penalty shots for the team.
*'''[[Duelling]]''':  Alicia attended the [[Duelling Club]] in her fourth year.<ref name="COS11"/> She was also taught both defensive and offensive spells by [[Harry Potter]], while attending meetings of [[Dumbledore's Army]].<ref name="OOTP19"/> She later bravely fought in the Battle of Hogwarts<ref name="DH30"/> and likely survived, as she was not mentioned among the [[Fallen Fifty]].
*'''[[Charm]]s''': She took [[Charms (class)|Charms]] to [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level, meaning she must have achieved either an "[[Outstanding]]" or "[[Exceeds Expectations]]" at [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]].<ref name="OOTP15"/>

==Relationships==
===Gryffindor Quidditch team===
{{Quote|Oliver, this is mad, you can't let Harry deal with that thing on his own. Let's ask for an inquiry —|Alicia to [[Oliver Wood]] while a Bludger is chasing [[Harry Potter]]|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Q-team_gryf....jpg|250px|thumb|left|The [[Gryffindor]] [[Quidditch]] [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|team]] in [[1991]]]]

Alicia was a member of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], during her years at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. There, she became best friends with fellow members [[Angelina Johnson]], with whom she possibly shared a dormitory, and [[Katie Bell]], who was a year younger than her. Alicia, Angelina and Katie were also the only girls at the team.

She was also a good friend of the twins [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]]. Fred and George liked doing pranks and teasing the others, but defended their friends. When Fred and George were kicked off from the team by [[Dolores Umbridge]], Alicia was very angry with them, as their loss at the team would cost them the Quidditch cup.

Another friend of hers was [[Lee Jordan]]. Although he wasn't a member of the team, he was the Quidditch matches commentator, and strongly supported the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Lee liked doing pranks, too.

Alicia was also a close friend of [[Oliver Wood]], the Captain of the team. However, they argued several times, as in [[1992]]; Alicia shouted at Oliver, when he wanted Harry to keep on playing, while a Bludger was chasing him. Oliver had been very proud of the team by the end of the year; the year that they eventually won the Quidditch cup.

Other members of the team were [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. Harry, the [[Seeker]], was extremely good, but Ron had a lack of confidence, due to the [[Slytherin]]s making fun of him. Eventually, Ron was proved to be very good, as the members of the team, including Alicia, supported him and advised him not to be bothered by the Slytherins.

Alicia seemed to care about Harry, as he was her friend, and she thought he shouldn't keep on playing in [[1992]], while a Bludger was chasing him. She also went as far as to kiss Harry after he won them a match against Ravenclaw (along with Angelina and Katie). Alicia also became a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], in order to be taught [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] by Harry, and she later fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], alongside Harry and the other members of the team.

===Dumbledore's Army===
[[File:Dumbledore's_Army.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Dumbledore's Army]]]]

Alicia became a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]] in her [[seven]]th year. It was an organisation founded by [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] and led by Harry, in order to teach the members [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], something that professor [[Dolores Umbridge]] did not. Furthermore, they wanted to oppose Umbridge. Alicia was rather friendly with the most of them.

She appeared to be a close friend of [[Hermione Granger]], a Gryffindor girl two years younger than her. Alicia defended Hermione when [[Draco Malfoy]] insulted her. When Malfoy called Hermione a “mudblood”, Alicia screamed “HOW DARE YOU!” to Malfoy. Alicia and Hermione fought together at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

Alicia would have been on good terms with fellow Gryffindors [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Seamus Finnigan]], [[Dean Thomas]], [[Lavender Brown]], [[Parvati Patil]], [[Colin and Dennis Creevey]]. Other members of the army were [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]], [[Susan Bones]], [[Terry Boot]], [[Anthony Goldstein]], [[Michael Corner]], [[Zacharias Smith]], [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], [[Hannah Abbott]], [[Cho Chang]], [[Padma Patil]], [[Marietta Edgecombe]] and [[Luna Lovegood]]. Alicia would have disliked [[Marietta Edgecombe]], who betrayed the army to Umbridge, and [[Zacharias Smith]], who abandoned the army during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

==Etymology==
Alicia is related to Alice and ultimately the German Adalheid, meaning "noble type (of person) also kind and beauty." The last name really exists and is often spelled Spinnett. A spinet is a small upright piano. Alicia's name also may be a variation of spinner or spinney, a small grove of trees.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Alicia Spinnet LEGO.jpg|thumb|Alicia Spinnet as a LEGO minifigure]]
[[File:Alicia_Spinnet-HP_14.png|thumb|Alicia Spinnet in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]
*Alicia Spinnet was portrayed by [[Leilah Sutherland]] in {{PS|FA}} and by [[Rochelle Douglas]] for {{COS|FA}}. She also appeared in {{POA|FA}} during the the scene in the infirmary after the quidditch match, although she was not credited, so it's unknown who portrayed her.
**She is the only member of the original Gryffindor team to never have a speaking role in any of the films, despite having a distinctive reaction towards the word [[Mudblood]] in the books.<ref name="COS7"/>
**None of the actresses who previously portrayed Alicia have been asked to reprise the role for any of the other [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]],{{fact}}<!-- We know this, how? Do we know they actually haven't been asked? And that they themselves didn't decline to reprise the role? --> nor have any new ones been recast. She did not appear in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] scene in the ''Deathly Hallows'' film.
*Alicia Spinnet was voiced by [[Melanie Bright]] in {{QWC}}.<ref name="Mandy">[https://www.mandy.com/uk/voice-artist/melanie-bright-2 Melanie Bright's Mandy profile]</ref>
*Out of the three Chasers who played for Gryffindor during Harry's first five years at Hogwarts, Alicia is the only one to not be injured during a Quidditch match in any of the films (Angelina crashed into the stands in ''Philosopher's Stone'' and Katie's{{fact}} <!-- legit proof that it was "Katie"? the ref image used on Bell's page already contained error; Rionach O'Neal is labelled as Alicia--> broom caught fire in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'').
