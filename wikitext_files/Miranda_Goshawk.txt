'''Miranda Goshawk''' (b. [[1921]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and celebrated author who specialised in writing [[Charms (class)|Charms]] spellbooks. The ''[[The Standard Book of Spells|Standard Book of Spells]]'' was a collection written by her and were [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] textbooks that covered the entire [[Charm]]s syllabus. She also wrote a [[Herbology]] [[Goshawk's Guide to Herbology|encyclopedia]] and the third volume of the ''[[Which Owl?]]'' series.

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|I was born into a poor family, the last of nine sisters. When I was a youngster, there was no basic spellbook to give a beginner witch like myself the clear and simple instructions that would have made magic a much less mysterious process.|Miranda Goshawk, ''[[Book of Spells]]'' (''Foreword'')|Wonderbook: Book of Spells}}
Miranda Goshawk was born in [[1921]],<ref name="COSG"/> somewhere in [[Great Britain]], the last of nine daughters born to the wizarding [[Goshawk family]].<ref name="WBoS" /> Her family was relatively impoverished by the time she arrived, and she recalls having to wear her sisters' hand-me-down [[robes]], which she found "embarrassing".<ref name="WBoS"/>

[[File:Young Miranda MA.jpeg|250px|thumb|left|Miranda in her [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] [[Hogwarts uniform|uniform]]]]
In her youth, she received formal instruction, attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from approximately [[1932]] to [[1939]]. Miranda found the complicated instructions and abstruse concepts in her "old-fashioned textbooks" rather hard to understand. To further her confusion when it came to learning magic, her sisters used to deliberately give her the wrong [[incantation]] for every [[spell]] she attempted.<ref name="WBoS"/>

As the youngest child in a large family, she also often found it difficult to make herself heard, and sometimes resorted to using the [[Bat-Bogey Hex]] — which she invented herself — to render whoever she wanted to give a piece of her mind silent long enough to let her speak. She used it on her sister [[Diadema Goshawk|Diadema]] to get her to return clothes she borrowed without permission; on her sister [[Romilda Goshawk|Romilda]] to keep her out of her room when she wanted to be left alone; and on her sister [[Tangwystl Goshawk|Tangwystl]] when she wanted to keep her quiet so she could finish her homework.<ref name="WBoS"/>

During her childhood and school years, Miranda also wrote down her thoughts onto a [[Miranda Goshawk's spell journal|spell journal]], which would be found by a [[Tiburon Merriweather's great-grandchild|Muggle-born Hogwarts student]] almost a century later.<ref name="MAABOT">{{MA|ABOT}}</ref>

At some point, Miranda wanted to give her [[Goshawk sisters' grandmother|grandmother]] a [[magic]]al bouquet of flowers, so her sisters told her the incantation was that of the [[Dancing Feet Spell]] (''Tarantallegra''). This incident inspired her to invent the [[Bouquet Spell]] (''Orchideous'').<ref name="MAABOT2">{{MA|ABOT|2}}</ref>

===Adult life===
[[File:Goshawk.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Miranda in her younger years]]
After her schooling, in which she self-admittedly "struggled", Ms. Goshawk realised that the help she had needed as a young witch simply did not exist. In response to this, she made a living by writing school textbooks all the while striving to make her writings both scientifically correct and academically useful, but also appealing and plain enough to be understood without too much difficulty, allowing every student to be in possession of knowledge about "''basic and not-so-basic''" witchcraft.<ref name="WBoS"/>

Her first book, the ''[[Book of Spells]]'', was a success: it was not only translated into seventy-two languages (among them, [[Gobbledegook]] and [[Mermish]]), but it also became an approved textbook in many schools for magic around the world. Goshawk did not miss the opportunity to get back at her sisters for their mischievous pranks: she had "special editions" of ''[[Book of Spells]]'' (actually just editions with several misprints) sent to them. As a result, and as part of a series of "comical mishaps", her sister [[Romilda Goshawk|Romilda]] was left with a tail, and Miranda's relationship with her sisters was negatively affected. Goshawk notes that the tail eventually vanished, and that the sisters became friends again.<ref name="WBoS"/>

Goshawk's decision to include [[jinx]]es in the school textbook ''[[Book of Spells]]'' was controversial. She later defended it by stating that she believed including mild offensive spells in the book would deter students from seeking out more dangerous spells with which to settle their disputes.<ref name="WBoS" />

It was around this time, presumably, that Ms. Goshawk penned the ''[[The Standard Book of Spells]]'' series, a collection of [[Charms (class)|Charms]] textbooks that have been regularly requested at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]<ref name="PS5">{{PS|B|5}}</ref> by [[Charms Master]] [[Filius Flitwick]], regarded as "''the best and most knowledgeable Charms master alive in the world today''",<ref name="Pottermore">{{PM}}</ref> further attesting to the prestige of Goshawk's works. Ms. Goshawk has also published a comprehensive [[Goshawk's Guide to Herbology|encyclopedia of Herbology]]<ref name="GFf">{{GOF|F}}</ref> and has written the third volume of the ''[[Which Owl?]]'' collection.<ref name="CSf">{{COS|F}}</ref>

[[File:Miranda Goshawk Chocolate Frog Card HM.png|200px|thumb|left|Miranda on a Chocolate Frog Card]]
In recognition of her efforts in the teaching of magic, Miranda Goshawk was immortalised in a [[Chocolate Frog Card]] bearing her effigy and achievements.

During the [[Calamity]] in the late [[2010s]] or early [[2020s]], Miranda Goshawk visited a [[professor]] member of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] and engaged in a one-on-one lesson on scaling defensive [[spell]]s with them, increasing the amount of damage they could do in combat.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
Goshawk was an intelligent witch who authored ''[[The Standard Book of Spells]]'' series to provide clear [[magic]]al education to young [[Wizardkind|witches and wizards]].

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Charm]]s mastery''': Goshawk was shown to be good with charms, having authored the ''[[The Standard Book of Spells]]'' series, which contained information on how to perform a very wide variety of different charms and [[spell]]s. Her books were often used in Charms classes at Hogwarts for their usefulness. Her abilities in Charms were further shown by the complex and powerful enchantments she placed on her original [[Book of Spells]], where it could project the speeches she had made to greet those who read the book and create safe spaces or dangerous places for practising spells.<ref name="WBoS" />
*'''[[Poetry]]''': Goshawk wove five poems for ''[[Book of Spells]]''.
*'''[[Herbology]]''': Goshawk was also knowledgeable of Herbology and herself a [[Herbologist]], the study of [[magic]]al and mundane plants and fungi, having written an expansive encyclopedia on the subject, titled ''[[Goshawk's Guide to Herbology]]''.
*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': Although not a well-known talent of hers, Goshawk was evidently quite apt in handling magical [[creature]]s, as she was at least good enough in handling [[owl]]s to author the third book in the ''[[Which Owl?]]'' series.
*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal magic]]''': Her books covered descriptions and instructions how to cast [[nonverbal spell]]s, showing she had the knowledge of how to do so.
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Goshawk was also good with Transfiguraton, as she could turn [[Human to toad spell|people into toads]].<ref name="WBoS" />
*'''[[Spell creation]]''': Goshawk in her youth invented the [[Bat-Bogey Hex]] and the [[Bouquet Spell]] herself.<ref name="WBoS" /><ref name="MAABOT2"/>
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Goshawk was shown to be rather skilled with the Dark Arts, as she successfully created the [[Bat-Bogey Hex]] in her youth.<ref name="WBoS" /> Though ''[[The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1]]'' did not teach students [[dark charm]]s, in her original Book of Spells,<ref name="PM-standard-1">{{PM}} - ''[[The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1]]''</ref> she included the instructions on how to cast the [[Knockback Jinx]], the [[Impediment Jinx]], and [[Reductor Curse]].<ref name="WBoS" />

==Published works==
*''[[Book of Spells]]''
*''[[The Standard Book of Spells]]'' series, including:
**''[[The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1]]''
**''[[The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2]]''
**''[[The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 3]]''
**''[[The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4]]''
**''[[The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5]]''
**''[[The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 6]]''
**''[[The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 7]]''
*''[[Which Owl?|Which Owl?, Volume 3]]''

==Etymology==
*Miranda is from Spanish and means "admirable" or "beautiful." A goshawk is a large, powerful species of hawk with rounded wings, long tail and brown or grey feathers. It is also pronounced like "''Got chalk''" nodding towards her teaching standard.

==Behind the scenes==
*Miranda Goshawk was voiced by [[Rachel Atkins]] in the English edition of {{WBS}}.
*''[[Book of Spells]]'' was purportedly "200 years old",<ref name="rowlingofficial">[http://www.jkrowling.com/en_US/timeline/wonderbook-book-of-spells Rowling Announcement About ''Wonderbook: Book of Spells'']</ref> suggesting it was published sometime in [[1812]] (200 years prior to 2012, the year in which the game was released) or [[1791]]-[[1798]] (200 years before the time setting of the [[Harry Potter series|''Harry Potter'' novels]]. Possible explanations include that the game is set sometime after [[After 2025|2121]] or that the Chocolate Frog Card gave an incorrect birth date, or that the developers simply do not care about these things nearly as much as the fans.
*Neville Longbottom mentions ''[[Goshawk's Guide to Herbology]]'' while talking to [[Harry Potter]] about plants to help him with the second task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]].
*According to {{AMHL}}, the developers wanted to include the [[Bat-Bogey Hex]] in {{HL}}, but couldn't due to Miranda, its inventor, not being born until after the time the game in which the game is set.
