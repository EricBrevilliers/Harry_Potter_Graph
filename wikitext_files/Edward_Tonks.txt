{{Quote|Knew they were coming for me. Heard Death Eaters were in the area last week and decided I'd better run for it. Refused to register as a Muggle-born on principle, see, so I knew it was a matter of time, knew I'd have to leave in the end.|Ted regarding his standing under Voldemort's new regime|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

'''Edward "Ted" Tonks'''<ref name="Pottermore">{{HPcom|remus-lupin}} - "The Lupins' son, Edward Remus ('Teddy'), was named for Remus's recently deceased father-in-law."</ref> (d. [[March]] [[1998]]) was a [[Muggle-born]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]]. He was the husband of [[Andromeda Tonks]] {{c|née [[House of Black|Black]]}}, father of [[Nymphadora Tonks]], and grandfather of [[Edward Lupin|Teddy Lupin]]. He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where he was sorted into an unknown House.

When Ted married Andromeda, who was born into a prejudiced [[pure-blood]] family, her family singled her out for scorn. The couple had one child, Nymphadora, who became a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] during the [[Second Wizarding War]]. Ted and Andromeda were not members of the Order but assisted them occasionally, allowing the Order to use their home as a safe-house during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]].

When [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] succeeded in taking over the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in [[1997]] and the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]] was established, Ted went on the run. He was eventually caught and murdered by a group of [[Snatchers]] in March of 1998.

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|Andromeda married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks, so —|[[Sirius Black]] regarding the Tonks family|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Andromeda and Ted.jpg|230x230px|thumb|Ted and Andromeda on the Black family tree|alt=|left]]

Ted was born into the [[Tonks family]] but, unlike his [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Edward Tonks's father|relatives]], was a [[wizardkind|wizard]]. He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was in the same year as [[Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]], [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]], and [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Black]]. He met Andromeda during their [[first year]] [[Potions (class)|potions class]], where he knocked over a [[Cure for Boils]] [[potion]]. As Bellatrix and Narcissa laughed, Andromeda helped him clean up. He later managed to ask her out on a date to the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]], after which they started dating.<ref name="HMASMOL"/>

He eventually married [[Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda Black]], who he affectionately called "''Dromeda''", in spite of her [[House of Black|family]]'s belief in [[Blood status|blood purity]]. She was disowned and burned off the [[House of Black#Family Tree|family tree]] tapestry in the House of Black for not making a "''respectable pure-blood marriage''", unlike her sisters [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]] and [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]]. Ted and his wife had one child, for whom Andromeda selected the name Nymphadora.<ref name="OTP">{{OOTP}}</ref>

Ted and his daughter, whom he fondly called "''Dora''", lacked the talent for magical cleanliness that Andromeda had. He was aware of [[Arthur Weasley]] and his fascination with [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] items.<ref name="DH">{{DH}}</ref>

===Second Wizarding War {{c|1995-1998}}===
{{Quote|Hagrid's fine, son. The wife's seeing to him now. How are you feeling? Anything else broken? I've fixed your ribs, your tooth, and your arm. I'm Ted, by the way, Ted Tonks —  Dora's father.|Ted meets Harry Potter after the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

When [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] returned to power, Ted's daughter joined the second [[Order of the Phoenix]] to fight against the growing threat.<ref name="OTP" /> Neither Ted nor Andromeda were official members, but nonetheless supported their daughter and allowed their home to be used as a safe-house. In [[1997]], Tonks married [[Remus Lupin]], who suspected that Ted and Andromeda disapproved because of his [[werewolf]] status.

After the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], [[Harry Potter]] and [[Rubeus Hagrid]] crashed in the garden of the Tonks home and were both injured. Ted brought the two inside, where he proceeded to fix Harry's broken ribs, tooth and arm. He and Andromeda were very worried for their daughter's safety when Harry informed them that [[Death Eaters]] ambushed the group. Ted attempted to calm Andromeda down by pointing out that Dora had faced worse during the course of her career as an [[Auror]].<ref name="DH5">{{DH|B|5}}</ref> 

After Harry and Hagrid took the [[Portkey]] to [[The Burrow]], Ted sent the pieces of [[Sirius Black]]'s [[Sirius Black's motorbike|flying motorbike]] to Arthur Weasley. Arthur kept the motorbike in The Burrow's shed for the remainder of the war.

====On the run====
{{Dialogue|Dirk Cresswell|You believe that story, then, do you, Ted? You believe [[Severus Snape|Snape]] killed [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]?|Ted|Course I do. You're not going to sit there and tell me you think Potter had anything to do with it?|Ted and others while on the run form Snatchers |Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

When the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] fell under [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s control in August [[1997]], all known safe-houses of the Order lost their protective enchantments and were raided by mixtures of Ministry employees and [[Death Eaters]]. Ted and Andromeda were [[Cruciatus Curse|tortured]] for information about Harry, like many other families with connections to Order members. Remus later reported that they were "''shaken, obviously, but otherwise okay''". 

Some time after Ted and his wife were tortured, their daughter came to stay with them upon discovering that she was pregnant. Remus temporarily left her side, worried about passing on [[werewolf|lycanthropy]] to their child.

When the Ministry began its persecution of [[Muggle-born]]s, Ted, on a matter of principle, refused to register with the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]]. He was forced to leave to avoid Death Eaters who were operating near his home. Andromeda did not accompany him, as her [[pure-blood]] status kept her safe and she had to care for their pregnant daughter.

Ted then went on the run, eventually meeting up with fellow fugitives [[Dirk Cresswell]] and [[Dean Thomas]], as well as goblins [[Griphook]] and [[Gornuk]], and they proceeded to stay on the move throughout the countryside. At one point, the group discussed [[Harry Potter]] — unaware that Harry was listening in, along with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]]. Ted dismissed the ''[[Daily Prophet]]<nowiki>'</nowiki>''s claims that Harry was involved in Albus Dumbledore's death and stated his belief that ''[[The Quibbler]]'' was the only place left to get reliable news.

====Death====
{{Quote|Let's take a moment to report those deaths that the ''Wizarding Wireless Network News'' and ''Daily Prophet'' don't think important enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell.|[[Lee Jordan]] announces Ted's murder in ''[[Potterwatch]]''|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
Eventually, the group was caught by a gang of [[Snatchers]] led by [[Fenrir Greyback]]. Ted, Dirk, and Gornuk were murdered resisting capture.<ref name="DH" />

===Post-mortem===
The death of Ted Tonks and his comrades was announced on ''[[Potterwatch]]'', as the ''Daily Prophet'' and the ''[[Wizarding Wireless Network News]]'' had ceased reporting deaths caused by Voldemort's regime. When Nymphadora gave birth to her son, she and Remus decided to name him [[Edward Lupin|Edward]], or "Teddy", in her father's memory.<ref name="DH" />

==Physical description==
Ted was a "''fair-haired, big-bellied''" man, with a mellow and pleasant voice.<ref name="desc" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Healing magic]]''': Ted was shown to be proficient in the [[magic]]al art of healing, as he was able to repair [[Harry Potter]]'s broken tooth after the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], showing he was skilful with the casting of [[Healing spell]]s.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Ted was shown to be competent with charm-work, as shown when he swiftly and successfully used the [[Summoning Charm]] to summon some [[salmon]] out of [[water]] to eat whilst living as an outlaw in the English countryside.

==Relationships==
===Family===
====Andromeda Black====
[[File:Andromeda Tonks HM.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Andromeda Tonks]], his wife.]]
{{quote|It took a bit of doing to get 'Dromeda to agree to a first date. She had to slip away from her sisters, you see.|Ted talking about his first date with Andromeda.|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
Andromeda and Ted met at Hogwarts, where their relationship began. Although Andromeda was interested in Ted, her sisters proved to be an impediment to their relationship. She eventually agreed to go on a date with Ted and managed to slip away from her sisters, joining Ted for a [[Butterbeer]] in the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]]. According to Ted, she took one sip and smiled, which was when he knew 'it was all over for him'.<ref name="HMASMOL">{{HM|3|A SECRET MESSAGE OF LOVE}}</ref> After this date, Ted sent Andromeda a flower from their first date and would send her love notes as well.<ref name="AHH">{{HM|3|ANDROMEDA'S HOGWARTS HOMECOMING}}</ref>

Andromeda most likely married Ted (a [[Muggle-born]]) in secret before telling her family<ref>{{DH|B|1}} - Bellatrix: “She is no niece of ours, my Lord,” she cried over the outpouring of mirth. “We — Narcissa and I — have never set eyes on our sister since she married the Mudblood. This brat has nothing to do with either of us, nor any beast she marries.”</ref>. She was disowned from her family and burned off the [[House of Black#Black family tree|Black Family Tree]]. Considering that Andromeda gave up her entire family for Ted, they definitely had a strong and affectionate relationship. Ted called his wife by the nickname "Dromeda".

Andromeda was devastated when her husband was murdered by [[Snatchers]].{{Fact}}

====Nymphadora Tonks====
[[File:Nymphadora Tonks DH promo headshot .jpg|217x217px|thumb|left|[[Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Lupin]], his daughter and only child]]

Ted and [[Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]]'s only child was born sometime in [[1973]]. She was named Nymphadora by her mother, but she was nicknamed "Dora" by her father, which she preferred to Nymphadora. Ted disapproved of her using 'Tonks' as a name, as that was his surname and not her given name, but joked around with her about it. Ted and his daughter had a close relationship due to Andromeda being disowned by the [[House of Black]], which brought the three of them close together. Ted and Tonks both shared a dislike for the House of Black due to their treatment of Andromeda, and Tonks's assertion that family didn't have to be a blood relative helped Tonks in developing long-lasting friendships. The pair were both quite alike, and Andromeda claimed that Tonks took after he father more than her. Both were quite clumsy, frequently knocking things over, something which [[Rosmerta]] was aware of and joked about.<ref name="HMASMOL"/>

====Remus Lupin====
[[File:Remus Lupin Deathly Hallows promo image.jpg|220x220px|thumb|right|[[Remus Lupin]], his son-in-law]]
Remus married Ted's daughter, Nymphadora; neither Ted nor Andromeda attended [[Wedding of Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks|the wedding]], but only because they did not know about it<ref>Pottermore states that the only witnesses to the wedding were people from the local tavern in the north of the country.</ref>. Remus's [[werewolf]] status was most likely never a problem for Ted, given his open-mindedness.

==Etymology==
{{W|Edward}} is derived from the Old English words ''ead'', meaning "blessed", and ''weard'', meaning "guard", and has been the name of many members of the English nobility and royalty.

==Behind the scenes==
*Ted Tonks and his wife Andromeda were both cut from {{DH|F1}}, meaning that Harry and Hagrid escape to [[The Burrow]] rather than the [[Tonks house]]. The trio also do not encounter Ted nor any other members of his group while on the run. However, he, Dirk Cresswell, and Gornuk are mentioned on radio as having been killed.
*It is possible that Ted Tonks was a [[Metamorphmagus]], a magical trait he could have passed onto [[Nymphadora Tonks|his daughter]], but this is highly unlikely since he could have used this ability to disguise himself while on the run.
