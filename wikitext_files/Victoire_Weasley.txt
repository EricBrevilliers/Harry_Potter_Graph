'''Victoire Weasley''' (b. [[2 May]]<ref name="JKRV" /> [[2000]], [[2001]], or [[2002]])<ref name="birthyear"/> was a [[Half-Veela|part]]-[[veela]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and the eldest child and daughter of [[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur Weasley]] {{c|née [[Delacour family|Delacour]]}}.<ref name="msnbc">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0729-dateline-vieira.html J.K. Rowling MSNBC Interview] on Accio! Quote</ref> She had two younger siblings, [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]] and [[Louis Weasley]]. Victoire started her education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] between [[2011]] and [[2014]]. She was also the girlfriend of [[Edward Lupin]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Victoire was born on [[2 May]]<ref name="JKRV" /> in [[2000]], [[2001]] or [[2002]]. She was given her name, which means "victory" in French, because her date of birth fell on the anniversary of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], in which [[Harry Potter]], the [[Order of the Phoenix]], and allies prevailed against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]].<ref name="JKRV" />

Victoire has two younger siblings: a sister, [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]], and a brother, [[Louis Weasley|Louis]].<ref name="WFT">"[http://ehttps://archive.ph/qJjm4#selection-1403.0-1403.57 The Unwritten Story of Harry's Friends and Their Children]" from the Times Online (Archived)</ref> Through her maternal great-grandmother, Victoire was [[Half-Veela|one-eighth]] [[Veela]]. It is possible she lived at [[Shell Cottage]] with her family.

===Hogwarts years===
{{Quote|Meanwhile, Mr and Mrs Bill Weasley might like to know that their beautiful, blonde daughter Victoire seems to be attracted to any dark corner where Master Lupin happens to be lurking. The good news is both of them seem to have invented a method of breathing through their ears.|[[DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY REUNITES AT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP FINAL]]|Pottermore}}
Victoire began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[2011]] or [[2012]].

When Victoire accompanied the rest of her family to the [[Quidditch World Cup]] in 2014, presumably she and Teddy Lupin were already in a relationship, as Rita Skeeter wrote of them snogging often. So much, in fact, they had their own section in Rita's article. The two of them sat together during the final match between [[Bulgaria]] and [[Brazil]], but they each seemed more interested in talking to each other than watching the match. Victoire's father finally swapped places with her and directed her attention to the pitch, although she sulked about it. Later, she and Teddy managed to "''find their way back into adjacent seats''".<ref name="PMRS" />

On September 1st, 2017, Victoire's by-then-graduated boyfriend came to see her off for another year at [[King's Cross Station]]. Victoire's cousin, [[James Potter (II)|James Potter]], saw the couple snogging and interrupted them. When Teddy told him to leave, James returned to tell his family what he had seen, and his younger sister, [[Lily Potter (II)|Lily]], expressed her wish that Teddy and Victoire would marry someday, making Teddy an official part of the extended [[Weasley family|Weasley]]-[[Potter family|Potter]] clan.<ref>{{DH}}, Epilogue</ref>

==Physical description==
Victoire was described as "''very good-looking''",<ref name="msnbc" /> which presumably indicates that she took after either her mother, [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]], or her father, [[William Weasley|Bill]], or both, in appearance, as they both were described as good-looking. It could also link to her Veela ancestry, which might consequently make her beauty more profound. [[Rita Skeeter]] described her as blonde and beautiful.<ref name="PMRS" />

==Etymology==
Victoire means "victory" in [[France|French]], the native language of her mother [[Fleur Delacour]], and her name was chosen because she was born on the anniversary of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] being won.

==Behind the scenes==
*Both Victoire and [[Edward Lupin|Teddy Lupin]] have fathers who were attacked by the werewolf [[Fenrir Greyback]].
*Both Victoire and Teddy Lupin have mothers with unique traits related to their physical appearances — [[Fleur Delacour]] has [[Veela]] blood, and [[Nymphadora Tonks]] was a [[Metamorphmagus]].
*Victoire and Teddy are fourth cousins once removed as they are both distant descendants of [[Phineas Nigellus Black]].<ref>[[House of Black#Family Tree|Black family tree]]</ref>
*In {{JKYL}}, when sketching the Weasley family tree, Rowling stated that Victoire was so named because she was born on the anniversary of the day the [[Second Wizarding War]] [[2 May|ended]].
*As far as can be determined, Victoire was the first grandchild of [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Molly Weasley]]. The likelihood of this is increased by the fact that Bill Weasley was the first of their children to get married.
*Victoire is the last character introduced in the Harry Potter series.
*Victoire is likely an homage to Elanor Gamgee from ''{{W|The Lord of the Rings}}'', who was born on the anniversary of the downfall of Sauron. Both were noted to be very beautiful.
*Victoire is similar to her aunt, Ginny Weasley, in that both are women (last and first of their generations), both fell in love and have a relationship with war-orphaned men (Teddy Lupin and Harry Potter, respectively) and both were considered to be extremely beautiful from a young age.
