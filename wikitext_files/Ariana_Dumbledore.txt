{{Quote|It destroyed her, what they did: She was never right again. She wouldn't use magic, but she couldn't get rid of it; it turned inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn't control it, and at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless.|Aberforth, describing Ariana's unstable disposition|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
'''Ariana Dumbledore''' (c. [[1885]] – summer [[1899]])<ref name="death"/> was an [[England|English]] [[half-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and the youngest child and only daughter of [[Percival Dumbledore|Percival]] and [[Kendra Dumbledore]]. She was the younger sister of [[Albus Dumbledore|Albus]] and [[Aberforth Dumbledore]]. At the age of six, Ariana was attacked by [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Unidentified Mould-on-the-Wold boys|boys]] who saw her practising [[underage magic]], which left her traumatised to the point of rendering her [[magic]]al abilities uncontrollable. Ariana would later become an [[Obscurial]] as a result.<ref name="SOD">{{SOD}}</ref>

This prompted her father to attack the boys and be imprisoned in [[Azkaban]], while her mother moved the [[Dumbledore family|family]] from [[Mould-on-the-Wold]] to [[Godric's Hollow]] and kept Ariana hidden away from the general population. Because of this, the few people who saw Ariana often got the impression that she was being imprisoned.

During a fit when she was fourteen years old, Ariana accidentally caused a magical explosion that killed her mother. Her oldest brother Albus then became her guardian, a role that he resented.<ref name="DH35"/> Ariana died when she was accidentally struck by a curse in a three-way [[Duel at Godric's Hollow|duel]] between her older brothers and [[Gellert Grindelwald]], the soon-to-be infamous [[Dark wizard]] revolutionary.<ref name="DH35"/> This event would have a profound impact on both her brothers' lives.

After the incident, her eldest brother Albus would become a [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] [[professor]] and then the longest and most noted [[Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], while her favourite brother Aberforth became the owner and barman of the [[Hog's Head Inn]] in [[Hogsmeade]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, by three Muggle boys. They'd seen her practising magic, spying through the back garden hedge: She was a kid, she couldn't control it, no witch or wizard can at that age. What they saw, scared them, I expect. They forced their way through the hedge, and when she couldn't show them the trick, they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it.|Ariana's brutal and unprovoked attack|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Ariana coloured.jpg|150px|left|thumb|A young Ariana before the attack]]
Ariana Dumbledore was born to [[Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra]] and [[Percival Dumbledore]] in [[1885]] in the mainly wizarding village of [[Mould-on-the-Wold]]. Ariana lived a fairly normal and happy childhood up until the age of six years old.

In [[1891]], six-year-old Ariana Dumbledore was outside in the back garden hedge playing with her [[Underage magic|uncontrolled use]] of [[magic]]. Without her knowing, three [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Unidentified Mould-on-the-Wold boys|boys]] had been spying on her. After becoming scared of what they witnessed, they confronted her. The boys tried to get Ariana to show them her trick, but when she was unable to because of her young age, they turned violent and started to [[Attack on Ariana Dumbledore|attack]] her to stop her from using magic. 

As a result of the attack, she became traumatised to the point of her unwillingness to use magic, causing her to develop an [[obscurus]]. This caused her to have violently powerful magical accidents and outbreaks. Despite the instability of Ariana's [[Obscurial|condition]], she was not detained at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]], as her father never revealed the reason for his attack on the Muggle boys in her defence.<ref name="DH28"/><ref name="SODS">{{SOD|S}}</ref>

[[File:Percival Dumbledore in Azkaban.png|250px|thumb|[[Percival Dumbledore]] in [[Azkaban]]]]
Her father sought revenge against the boys and attacked them. Because of this, he was sentenced to [[Azkaban]]. He refused to reveal the reason for the attack, since Ariana would have been sent to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]] if her condition was discovered, as it threatened the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy|Statute of Secrecy]].<ref name="DH28">{{DH|B|28}}</ref>

About a year later, in [[1892]], to keep her daughter safe, Kendra moved the family to [[Godric's Hollow]] and Ariana was secluded from the outside world.<ref name="DH28"/> Many did not even know that the Dumbledores had a daughter. Ariana was sweet and kind, but when she could not control her magic she became slightly dangerous, even to Kendra, so she was never even sent to Hogwarts despite her family's attempts to fix her problem in secrecy. In fact, many believed Kendra had produced a [[Squib]] because Ariana did not attend Hogwarts.

===Mother's death===
{{Quote|...Ariana couldn't control it. But my mother was killed.|[[Aberforth Dumbledore]] about his mother's death|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
When Ariana was fourteen years old, she had an episode in which her emotions and her magic spun out of control. Her favourite brother Aberforth was not at home to calm her down, and she accidentally caused an explosion that caused the death of her [[Kendra Dumbledore|mother]].

[[Albus Dumbledore]], who had been preparing to go abroad with his friend, [[Elphias Doge]], stayed in [[England]] in order to attend his mother's funeral and to take over the position of taking care of Ariana. Aberforth wanted to be the one to take care of his sister, but he had not yet finished his education, and his older brother insisted upon him graduating from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].<ref name="DH28"/>

===Death===
{{Quote|I resented it, Harry. I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to shine. I wanted glory. Do not misunderstand me. I loved them... but I was selfish... So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! And then of course, ''he'' came...|Explanation of Ariana's death|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Ariana's brother [[Albus Dumbledore|Albus]] with his friend [[Gellert Grindelwald]]]]
At some point after Albus became Ariana's guardian, [[Gellert Grindelwald]] came to [[Godric's Hollow]] to stay with his great-aunt, [[Bathilda Bagshot]], having been kicked out of [[Durmstrang Institute]] for his extreme experiments with the [[Dark Arts]]. Grindelwald also had a history of violence which Albus chose to ignore when they met. Albus and Gellert quickly became friends, as they were both extraordinarily talented and very ambitious. The two formed a plan to take over the wizarding world and make [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] subservient "for the greater good". 

[[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]] confronted them over these plans, pointing out that Ariana was in no state to be dragged along with them as they pursued their dreams. Grindelwald became furious, insisting that once they subdued the Muggles, there would be no need for Ariana to be hidden. A three-way [[Duel at Godric's Hollow|duel]] broke out between him, Albus, and Aberforth. Ariana, aged about fourteen at the time and unable to control her magic, tried to stop it, and was inadvertently killed; it was never known which of the three wizards was directly responsible for her death.<ref name="DH28"/>

===Post-mortem===
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Aberforth Dumbledore|And Albus was free, wasn't he? Free of the burden of his sister, free to become the greatest wizard of the-|Harry Potter|He was never free.|I beg your pardon?|The night your brother died, he drank a [[Emerald Potion|potion]] that drove him out of his mind.... He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana... it was torture to him, if you'd seen him then, you wouldn't say he was free.|[[Aberforth Dumbledore]] and [[Harry Potter]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

[[File:ArianaDumbledorePortrait.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Aberforth Dumbledore]]'s portrait of Ariana]]

Immediately after Ariana's death, Grindelwald fled the scene, fearing retribution from the authorities and losing his friendship with Albus permanently, though it seems they retained some affection towards one another.

At Ariana's funeral, Aberforth grew angry and broke Albus's nose, then vocally blamed him for their sister's death.<ref name="DH8">{{DH|B|8}}</ref> Aberforth never forgave his brother for his part in her death after that, nor was Albus ever able to forgive himself.<ref name="DH35">{{DH|B|35}}</ref> Ariana was buried in the same location as her mother in Godric's Hollow, and they shared a gravestone bearing the epitaph, "''Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also''," selected by Albus.

In the [[Mirror of Erised]], Albus would forever see his family whole and intact with Ariana alive and using magic, although, when questioned, he claimed to see himself holding only a pair of socks he liked. [[Rita Skeeter]] wrote a scathing biography of Albus Dumbledore after his death in [[1997]], and included humiliating false statements about Ariana being a [[Squib]] whom the family mistreated.<ref name="DH11">{{DH|B|11}}</ref>

A portrait of Ariana hung in Aberforth's room in the [[Hog's Head Inn]] in [[Hogsmeade]]. It concealed a secret passage to the [[Room of Requirement]] in [[Hogwarts Castle]].<ref name="DH28"/> 

[[File:Secrets of Dumbledore - Albus Dumbledore observing the Blood Pact.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Albus Dumbledore standing infront of the Ariana's portrait]] 

In [[1932]], Albus Dumbledore stood behind his younger sister's portrait while observing his [[blood pact]].<ref name="SODS">{{SOD|S}}</ref>

Later, Dumbledore, looking at Ariana's portrait, explained to [[Newton Scamander]] that Ariana was an [[Obscurial]], much like her nephew [[Aurelius Dumbledore|Credence Barebone]]. However, unlike Credence, Ariana never learned to express her magic and every time it grew darker, Ariana's magic began to poison her and worst of all, none of her family could ease her pain. Dumbledore explained how Ariana had died during the duel between himself, Aberforth and Grindelwald and Newt suggested that her death may have spared her some pain in a failed attempt to comfort his friend. As a result of having watched Ariana's Obscurial nature slowly poison and kill her, Dumbledore was aware that Credence was also dying.<ref name="SOD"/>

[[File:Ariana leaving her portrait.jpg|250px|thumb|Ariana leaving her portrait]]

In [[1998]], the secret passage behind her portrait appeared only after the students had begun using the Room of Requirement in their efforts to fight the Hogwarts administration under Headmaster [[Severus Snape]]. 

[[File:Arianas portrait.png|250px|thumb|left|Harry Potter standing next to Ariana's portrait]]

Aberforth told Ariana to open up the passage in order to transport [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] to Hogwarts with Neville Longbottom, and later other members of [[Dumbledore's Army]] and the [[Order of the Phoenix]] who answered the call to [[Battle of Hogwarts|defend the castle]] against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s encroaching army.<ref name="DH29">{{DH|B|29}}</ref>

==Physical description==
[[Harry Potter]] thought that Ariana, as an infant, "''was a little longer than a loaf of bread and no more distinctive-looking''".<ref name="DH11"/> At the age of fourteen, as depicted in her [[portrait]] in the [[Hog's Head]], she was described as "''a blonde girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of a vacant sweetness''".<ref name="DH28"/>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote| ''[...]'' the flashing lights and the bangs set her off, she couldn't stand it... and I think she wanted to help, but she didn't really know what she was doing, and I don't know which of us did it, it could have been any of us — and she was dead.|[[Aberforth Dumbledore]] recalling Ariana's death|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
Ariana was sweet and kind, but following the attack she suffered at the age of six, she was severely traumatised. Afterwards, she was unable to control her [[magic]]. At times, she was mad, strange, and dangerous, according to her brother Aberforth Dumbledore. On these occasions, she could let out her magic in uncontrolled explosions, like the one that killed her mother, which surely had a negative effect on Ariana's state. Most of the time, however, Ariana was not like this. According to Aberforth, when she was calm she would help him feed the goats. She was also brave, as she tried to intercede in the three-way [[Duel at Godric's Hollow|duel]] between Albus, Aberforth, and [[Gellert Grindelwald]], but was killed in the effort.<ref name="DH28"/> She was shown to be caring as well, especially for her 'favourite' brother Aberforth, further adding incentive to her stepping in to stop the duel.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Underage magic]]''': Ariana was capable of performing underage magic when she was six years old.<ref name="DH28"/> However after being attacked by the [[Unidentified Mould-on-the-Wold boys|Mould-on-the-Wold boys]] for witnessing her perform magic, she lost control of her magic, which became extremely dangerous and unstable,<ref name="DH28"/> with her becoming an [[Obscurial]].<ref name="SOD"/>
*'''[[Obscurial]]''': Ariana became an [[Obscurial]] after suffering extreme emotional trauma, which resulted in her developing a [[Dark Arts|dark]], parasitic energy which was known as an [[Obscurus]].<ref name="SOD"/> This power was extremely volatile and dangerous, which killed her mother [[Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra]] in an uncontrolled explosion.<ref name="DH28"/>

==Relationships==
===Parents===
{{Quote| ''[...]'' my father went after the bastards that did it, and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he'd done it, because if the Ministry had known what Ariana had become, she'd have been locked up in St Mungo's for good... We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about she was ill, and my mother looked after her, and tried to keep her calm and happy.|[[Aberforth Dumbledore]] regarding Percival and Kendra Dumbledore on their love and sacrifice for their only daughter|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Percival and Kendra Dumbledore.png|thumb|250x250px|Percival and Kendra Dumbledore, her parents who sacrificed everything for her|left]]
Ariana's parents, [[Percival Dumbledore|Percival]] and [[Kendra Dumbledore]], were devastated by their daughter's attack. Kendra moved the family to [[Godric's Hollow]] and looked after her daughter. Eventually, Ariana accidentally killed her mother in an explosion of uncontrolled [[magic]].<ref name="DH28"/> Because of this, little is known about their relationship. While she could not calm Ariana the way her younger son could, despite her efforts to ensure Ariana was kept happy, the fact that Kendra was able to live alone with Ariana while Aberforth was away at school implies that Kendra and Ariana bore a close mother-daughter relationship.

Kendra would often make [[Ariana Dumbledore's favourite soup|Ariana's favourite soup]] to calm her down, further showing the small things that together made the length Kendra was willing to go to in order to ensure her daughter's mental health. As such, Ariana was surely deeply affected by her mother's demise and her death might have had a deep impact on her, as Kendra was likely the most common figure in Ariana's life.

===Aberforth Dumbledore===
{{Quote|I was her favourite... She liked me best. I could get her to eat when she wouldn't do it for my mother, I could calm her down, when she was in one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she used to help me feed the goats.|[[Aberforth Dumbledore]] and his relationship with Ariana|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Aberforth Dumbledore.jpg|232x232px|thumb|[[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]], Ariana's brother]]
[[Aberforth Dumbledore]] was Ariana's older and likely favourite brother. After her attack, Aberforth was the only one who could calm her down when she flew into a rage, something even their [[Kendra Dumbledore|mother]] could not always accomplish. The two often fed goats together in their free time. Aberforth was not present when Ariana lost control of her [[magic]] and accidentally killed their mother, yet he did not blame for her the death, knowing Kendra's demise had been a tragic accident. 

Long after Ariana's death, Aberforth continued to keep a [[portrait]] of his late sister in the [[Hog's Head Inn]]. It concealed a secret passage to the [[Room of Requirement]] in [[Hogwarts Castle]] during the 1997-1998 school year.<ref name="DH28"/>

===Albus Dumbledore===
{{Quote|They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I feared him... You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister... I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life. I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me.|[[Albus Dumbledore]] to [[Harry Potter]] about his guilt over Ariana's death|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Albus Dumbledore - Richard Harris profile.jpg|left|thumb|282x282px|[[Albus Dumbledore]], Ariana's eldest brother]]
[[Albus Dumbledore]] was Ariana's eldest brother and was not nearly as close to his younger siblings as they were to each other. Although he loved his younger sister, Albus was resentful when he had to take responsibility for her after their [[Kendra Dumbledore|mother]]'s death, which forced him to stay at home, and abandon his ambitious plans. When he met Grindelwald, Albus and he made plans to start a revolution and planned to take Ariana with them. However, before this plan could ever be carried out, Ariana was killed when trying to intervene in a duel between Albus, Gellert, and Aberfoth. Ever since then, Albus would live the rest of his life feeling tremondous guilt and remorse for what happened to Ariana.<ref name="DH35"/>

From then on, Albus's [[Boggart]] would be Ariana's corpse. In [[1991]], [[Albus Dumbledore]] told [[Harry Potter]] that he saw himself holding a pair of thick, woollen socks when he looked into the [[Mirror of Erised]].<ref>{{PS}}</ref> However, in truth, he saw "''his family alive, whole and happy — Ariana, Percival and Kendra all returned to him, and Aberforth reconciled to him''". He did not want to admit it to anyone, especially Harry.<ref name="JKR">[http://www.mugglenet.com/app/news/full_story/1156 MuggleNet transcript of Bloomsbury Webchat]</ref>

==Etymology==
*{{w|Ariana (name)|Ariana}} derives from the Greek name ''Ariadne'', comprised of the elements αρι (''ari'') "most" and αδνος (''adnos'') "holy".<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/ariadne Behind the Name: Ariadne]</ref> In Greek mythology, Ariadne was a princess of Crete who helped Theseus slay the Minotaur. The legend revolves around the Labyrinth: a hidden and enclosed location where people were sent to die as tribute. In this way, Ariana's name nods to her secluded, tragic life and death.
*The name could also originate from the Welsh ''arian'', meaning "silver".

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:LEGO Ariana.png|200px|thumb|right|Ariana's portrait as depicted in {{LEGO|Y2}}]]
[[File:Brilliant Portrait of Ariana Dumbledore WU.png|200px|thumb|right|The portrait of Ariana as seen in {{WU}}]]
*[[Hebe Beardsall]] portrays Ariana Dumbledore in {{DH|F1}} and {{DH|F2}}<ref>"[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2009/5/30/deathly-hallows-casting-updates-teen-dumbldedore-cast-chris-rankin-returns-and-more Deathly Hallows Casting Updates: Teen Dumbledore Cast, Chris Rankin Returns (Updated)]" from The Leaky Cauldron</ref> and {{SOD}}.<ref>{{IMDb name|3661137|Hebe Beardsall}}</ref> She is one of the three credited actors to have appeared in both a ''Harry Potter'' film and a ''Fantastic Beasts'' film, playing the same character. The other ones being [[Jamie Campbell Bower]] as [[Gellert Grindelwald]] and [[Toby Regbo]] as [[Albus Dumbledore]].
*Although Ariana is identified in {{DH|F2}}, Aberforth does not explain how she died or her back-story as explained in the book. This might be because of that fact that Harry, at that moment, isn't interested in the situation that happened in the past.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160319021147/http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=127572 COS forums] (Archived)</ref>
*{{HPFW}} states that Ariana died in 1900, and that she was thirteen at the time. This seemingly runs contrary to her age and birth year in the books, perhaps indicating another difference between her character's story in the books and the films.
*The epitaph on [[Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra]] and Ariana's gravestone, which was made of [[granite]] — "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" - is Matthew 6:21 from the Christian Bible. This epitaph, chosen by [[Albus Dumbledore]], is curiously similar to the function of one of Albus Dumbledore's inventions, the [[Deluminator]].
*In the ''Harry Potter'' books Ariana has blonde hair but in the films, she has more of a dark blonde or light brown.
*In the 2022 movie {{SOD}}, Albus Dumbledore confirms that Ariana was an [[Obscurial]], just like [[Aurelius Dumbledore|Credence Barebone]]. This means that Ariana lived longer than the average Obscurial: Most Obscurials fail to survive past age 10, with the exception of Credence Barebone. It is unknown how much longer Ariana would have lived, had she not been killed in the duel between Albus and [[Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]].
**This also means that Ariana being an Obscurial was kept hidden by the Dumbledores; more than thirty years after her death it was widely believed no Obscurial had existed for at least a hundred years (though, since Newt Scamander had recently dealt with [[Unidentified Sudanese Obscurial|one]], this is clearly false). However, after seeing her power it is possible that this is what led to Grindelwald searching for Obscurials in 1926, as she must have been very powerful to survive past the age of ten. Therefore, witnessing first-hand the power of Obscurials strong enough to survive longer than normal would doubtlessly make Grindelwald believe that only Obscurials of her calibre could kill her elder brother. 
***Another more confusing part to this is Grindelwald's dismissive attitude of her as Aberforth stated. If he had known her as an Obscurial, he would have doubtlessly been intrigued by her potential and sought to understand her more, considering how he treated Credence, but Aberforth never mentioned Grindelwald having any interest in anyone but Albus. That said, Aberforth was never close to Albus and loathed Grindelwald, so he likely didn't bother to oversee the full extent of which they interacted, meaning it is still possible Grindelwald could have been more interested in her than he thought. Alternatively, as Grindelwald was said to have been willing to take her with him and Albus in their crusade, it's possible he may have, in fact, been aware of her Obscurial powers and possibly sought to train her along with Albus and just never got the chance until she was killed.
**Ariana being an Obscurial explains why her family worked so hard to keep her hidden, as Obscurials were considered extremely dangerous by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]], and she likely would have been killed, or kept under heavy guard at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]].
**''Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore'' also confirms that Credence Barebone is in fact Aurelius Dumbledore. This further justifies why Ariana may have also been an Obscurial, as this may have ran in the Dumbledore family. In addition, Albus pointed out that he felt Ariana was not given as much affection as she needed, which is similar to Credence's case.
*There are parallels between myth and Ariana's relationship with her two elder brothers, Albus and Aberforth, and their roles in her life and demise. Aberforth represents the heroic character of Theseus, fighting against Albus and Gellert Grindelwald (who function together as the dual-natured Minotaur). Aberforth was the most devoted to his sister, and was also her favourite; Ariadne also takes an instinctive liking to Theseus. As in the Greek myth, Ariana (Ariadne) enables Aberforth (Theseus) to defeat Albus and Gellert (the Minotaur). Additionally, both stories end in tragedy — Theseus betrays and deserts Ariadne on the island of Naxos. Reading Ariana's death through this myth, it can be argued that Aberforth may have cast the fatal blow. Alternately, it could be argued that he either failed or did not attempt to prevent her death. Ultimately, her death exists as a source of conflict between the Dumbledore siblings.
