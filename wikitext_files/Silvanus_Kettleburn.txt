{{Quote|Professor Kettleburn survived no fewer than sixty-two periods of [[probation]] during his employment as Care of Magical Creatures teacher.|Kettleburn's extreme recklessness|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}
'''Professor Silvanus Kettleburn''' (b. [[22 November]]<ref name="shortstories"/> pre-[[1927]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who, after graduating from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], served as [[professor]] of [[Care of Magical Creatures]].<ref name="POA5"/> 

His recklessness and the nature of his subject resulted in him losing all his limbs but one arm and half of one leg. He retired in [[1993]],<ref name="POA5"/> but still made visits to [[dragon]] sanctuaries.<ref name="shortstories"/>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Silvanus Kettleburn was born to [[Silvanus Kettleburn's father|a wizard]] and [[Silvanus Kettleburn's mother|a witch]] on [[22 November]]. He received magical instruction at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], in which he was Sorted into [[Hufflepuff]],<ref name="Pottermore"/> and presumably achieved high marks in [[Care of Magical Creatures]], later leading him to become a teacher in that subject.

At some point in his life, Silvanus owned [[Silvanus Kettleburn's twelve Nifflers|twelve pet Nifflers]]. They destroyed his home, his boat and his favourite replacement leg. Instead of being sad or angry, however, he was ecstatic and could hardly wait to get twelve more.<ref name="HM46cmc"/>

===Professor of Care of Magical Creatures===
====Under Headmaster Armando Dippet====
{{Quote|...it was several months before the Great Hall lost its pungent aroma of wood smoke, and even longer before Professor Beery's head reassumed its normal proportions, and Professor Kettleburn was taken off probation...|''The Fountain of Fair Fortune'' incident|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}
At some point during the early to mid-[[1920s]] or earlier, Silvanus met and befriended the famous [[Magizoologist]] [[Newton Scamander]], whom he helped with his best-selling book {{FB}} by providing some of the information it contained about [[Chimaera]]s.{{Fact}}

At some point in his life, Kettleburn became the [[Professor]] of [[Care of Magical Creatures]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]] under [[Headteacher|Headmaster]] [[Armando Dippet]]. During his time as a professor, Kettleburn received a blanket ban on bringing overtly dangerous beasts to class<ref>{{MA}} {{See image|File:ProfessorsPledge ClodaghDromgoole MA.jpg}}</ref> and amassed no less than sixty-two periods of [[Probation|probations]],<ref name="TBB">{{TBB|F}}</ref> one of which was when a worm he provided for the play of ''[[The Fountain of Fair Fortune]]'' (which was in fact, an [[Engorgement Charm|Engorged]] [[Ashwinder]]) exploded and started a [[fire]]. This started a [[Duelling|duel]] between the girls playing [[Amata]] and [[Asha]], in which [[Herbert Beery|Professor Herbert Beery]] was caught in the crossfire. Beery's head was reported to have been disfigured. It took him a long time for it to return to normal, which led to his retirement as a [[professor]].<ref name="TBB"/>

At some point in or after the 1969–1970 school year, a student by the name of [[Patricia Rakepick]] approached him for information about how to enter the [[Forbidden Forest]] undetected. Seen as how she was his most gifted pupil at the time of her inquiry, he questioned her as to why she wanted to go into the forest, to which she replied she merely wanted to explore it and to study the [[magic]]al [[creature]]s that dwelled within it, and told him she meant to become a [[Magizoologist]] after she left school. Accepting this explanation, he advised her to use a [[broomstick]].{{Fact}}

====Under Headmaster Albus Dumbledore====
{{Quote|By the time I became Headmaster, however, Professor Kettleburn had mellowed considerably, although there were always those who took the cynical view that with only one and a half of his original limbs remaining to him, he was forced to take life at a quieter pace.|Kettleburn mellowing due to his extensive injuries|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}
[[File:HM y4ch1 Silvanus Kettleburn.png|thumb|Professor Kettleburn teaching Care of Magical Creatures]]
By the time [[Albus Dumbledore]], the [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] [[Professor]], had taken over from Professor Dippet as [[Headteacher|Headmaster]], Professor Kettleburn had calmed down a considerable amount, though this was likely because he only had one and a half of his original limbs left:<ref name="TBB"/> one arm and half a leg.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

By the [[1980s]], Professor Kettleburn had long become one of the regulars at the [[Hospital Wing]] at the school, where he had been treated by [[Poppy Pomfrey]] for and subsequently recuperated from various creature-induced injuries at the [[Hospital Wing]] no less than nineteen times, to the point where he eventually had a bed reserved just for him. Even so, he apparently took this with a surprising amount of good humour, almost affectionately referring to the Hospital Wing as his 'home away from home' during his twentieth time visiting.

During the [[1986–1987 school year]], he was invited to visit a [[Magical Creature Reserve in Ireland|Magical Creature Reserve]] in [[Ireland]], and he left his baby [[Occamy]], [[Squawk]], in the care of the [[Hogwarts Hippogriff Club]].<ref name="ABO">{{HM|3|A BAD OMEN}}</ref> Later, during the [[1987–1988 school year]], he taught [[Fourth year|fourth-year]]s, [[Jacob's sibling]] for instance, classes on several magical creatures including [[Bowtruckle]]s,<ref name="HM43">{{HM|4|3|cmc}}</ref> [[Niffler]]s,<ref name="HM46cmc">{{HM|4|6|cmc}}</ref> [[Streeler]]s,<ref name="HM411">{{HM|4|11|cmc}}</ref> and [[Kneazle]]s.<ref name="HM413">{{HM|4|13|cmc}}</ref> He also bragged that he had won [[Hogsmeade's Most Maimed Award]] for ten years running.<ref name="HM4 Award">{{HM|4|3|cmc}} (see [https://youtu.be/PPTXBgJKggQ?t=183 this video])</ref>

In this school year, he spent a considerable time asking for students' help in locating a [[Silvanus Kettleburn's Chimaera|Chimaera]] loose some where on the grounds of Hogwarts.<ref name="HM41">{{HM|4|1}}</ref> Professor Kettleburn and [[Rubeus Hagrid]] had also been transporting a large number of magical creatures to the school for teaching purposes for the [[Care of Magical Creatures]], when they accidentally lost control over them and they escaped and overran [[Hogwarts Castle]], and got injured while in the process of rounding them up.<ref name="HM4 MCE">{{HM|4|Magical Creatures Everywhere}}</ref> He continued to teach these students until their graduation in [[1991]].

The Hogwarts student [[Jacob's sibling]] described his scent as the streets of [[Edinburgh]] after a storm.{{Fact}}

At some point during his tenure at Hogwarts, Kettleburn authored the internal Hogwarts guide ''[[Kettleburn's Classification of Chompers]]'', which detailed magical creatures that should be avoided by Hogwarts students, including [[Hippogriff]]s.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref><ref name="Date">This work is described as an "internal [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] guide, implying that it was published while Silvanus Kettleburn was still a professor at Hogwarts. Therefore, this guide must have been published prior to [[1993]], as this was the year that Kettleburn retired from teaching at the school.</ref>

===Retirement===
{{Quote|As to our second new appointment: well, I am sorry to tell you that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher, retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs. However, I am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid, who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties.|Announcement of Kettleburn's retirement|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}

Kettleburn remained in his position as Professor of [[Care of Magical Creatures]] until [[1993]], when he retired to spend more time with his remaining limbs. According to [[Rubeus Hagrid]], who succeeded him, Professor Dumbledore came straight to [[Hagrid's Hut|his hut]] after Kettleburn said that he had had enough.<ref name="POA5">{{POA|B|5}}</ref> As a retirement present, Albus Dumbledore presented Kettleburn with a set of [[Silvanus Kettleburn's prosthetics|enchanted wooden prosthetics]], which needed constant replacement due to his habit of visiting [[dragon]] sanctuaries.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

During his retirement, Professor Kettleburn moved to [[Hogsmeade]]. During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], his physical infirmities prevented him from fighting directly but, determined to play his part, he clambered into his attic of his [[Silvanus Kettleburn's house|house]] and threw his entire stock of [[Flobberworm]]s out of the skylight at passing [[Death Eaters]]. While this had little to no effect on the outcome of the battle, it was generally felt to show the right spirit.<ref name="shortstories"/>

He never married and had no children,<ref name="Pottermore"/> and died sometime prior to [[22 November]] [[2014]].<ref name="PMInsider"/>

==Personality and traits==
{{Dialogue a-b|Rita Skeeter|You regularly bring children face to face with creatures that could kill them in the blink of an eye.|Silvanus Kettleburn|And I teach them to understand and respect those creatures so no one gets hurt.|Professor Kettleburn refuting sensationalist reporter Rita Skeeter's claim that he did not take his job seriously|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
[[File:Professor Kettleburn smiling HM630.png|250px|thumb|right|Kettleburn's cheerful demeanour during a Care of Magical Creatures lesson]]
Silvanus Kettleburn had an extreme, professorial enthusiasm for the subject of [[Magizoology]] and great fondness for magical creatures of all kinds, especially the dangerous ones. Kettleburn was often cheerful but somewhat eccentric. Like [[Newton Scamander]], he advocated for the protection and preservation of magical creatures, informing his class that he would risk life and limb, and indeed had done so, to protect the magical creatures in his care. He was also quite dutiful in regards to his profession, brushing off [[Rita Skeeter]]'s accusation that he was regularly endangering his students by saying he was more careful with his students than he was with himself.

Despite this, Kettleburn was considered reckless by many people, including his former employer [[Armando Dippet]],<ref name="TBB"/> and not without good reason. Indeed: True though it might be that the numerous injuries he had suffered or the limbs he had lost throughout his life, by, in his eagerness, recklessly neglecting to take the proper safety precautions when dealing with beasts, Silvanus Kettleburn did not mind or regret any of them, as he regarded his mangled body as a testament to his dedication to his work.

In the lesson about [[Niffler]]s (with [[Patricia Rakepick]]'s pet Niffler [[Sickleworth]]), Kettleburn confided in her that he owned [[Silvanus Kettleburn's twelve Nifflers|twelve of them]], and still wanted twelve more, even when they had destroyed his [[Silvanus Kettleburn's boat|boat]], [[Silvanus Kettleburn's house|house]] and his favourite prosthetic leg.<ref name="HM46cmc"/>

One notable example of Kettleburn's recklessness was the ''[[The Fountain of Fair Fortune]]'' incident in the [[Great Hall]]. This incident resulted in a packed [[Hospital Wing]], a Great Hall smelling of burned wood, and [[Herbert Beery]]'s head growing out of proportion. Kettleburn had mellowed considerably by the time Dumbledore took over,<ref name="TBB"/> although he was regarded as a "''lovable if eccentric man''".<ref name="Pottermore"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Quote|Feel free to approach [[Hieronymus|him]], but watch out for his posterior, as it shoots flames capable of scorching your skin off. Don't you just love magical creatures? Let's begin!|Silvanus Kettleburn's enthusiasm for magical beasts, such as [[Fire Crab]]s|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': As the Professor of Care of Magical Creatures, Kettleburn was highly knowledgeable and proficient in the field of [[Magizoology]], the study of [[magic]]al [[creature]]s. He was particularly fond of dealing with dangerous [[beast]]s like his [[Rubeus Hagrid|successor]], such as [[Chimaera]]s, but was more than capable of handling and teaching his students about non-violent beasts as well.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Kettleburn appeared to be proficient with charms, given how he was able to successfully cast an [[Engorgement Charm]] on an [[Ashwinder]] [[snake]] to significantly enlarge its size,<ref name="TBB"/> and timely cast the [[Sleeping Charm]] to subdue a [[Ukrainian Ironbelly]].<ref name="HM6 ACB">{{HM|6|Adventures in Curse-Breaking}}</ref> He could also cast a successful [[Hurling Hex]].<ref name="HM5 AWV">{{HM|5|ALL-WIZARD VICTOR}}</ref>

==Possessions==
*'''[[Silvanus Kettleburn's house|House]]''': Kettleburn owned a small house in the village of [[Hogsmeade]] from where he would walk up to Hogwarts for work every day, and to which he retired to after leaving his profession.<ref name="shortstories"/>
*'''[[Silvanus Kettleburn's wand|Wand]]''': Like most wizards and witches, Professor Kettleburn owned a [[wand]], which was 11½ inches long, made of [[Chestnut (tree)|chestnut]] [[Wand wood|wood]] and had a [[phoenix feather]] [[Wand core|core]], which was described as being "whippy".<ref name="Pottermore"/>
*'''[[Silvanus Kettleburn's prosthetics]]''': Kettleburn was given [[Charm|enchanted]] wooden prosthetics by [[Albus Dumbledore]], that often needed replacing due his frequent visits to [[dragon]] sanctuaries.<ref name="shortstories"/>
*'''[[Silvanus Kettleburn's boat|Boat]]''': Kettleburn owned a boat, that was eventually destroyed by his pet Nifflers.<ref name="HM46cmc"/>
*'''[[Silvanus Kettleburn's twelve Nifflers|Nifflers]]''': At some point, Kettleburn owned twelve Nifflers that destroyed his house, boat, and favourite replacement leg; he could hardly wait to get twelve more.<ref name="HM46cmc"/>

==Etymology==
*"Silvanus" is a Roman name derived from Latin ''silva'', meaning "wood, forest". Silvanus was the Roman god of forests. "Kettleburn" may be a pun on his recklessness.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Kettleburn LEGO.jpg|thumb|Silvanus Kettleburn as a LEGO minifigure]]
*During the [[1992–1993 school year]], which would be Kettleburn's final year teaching, [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] stole a [[Fire Dwelling Salamander|salamander]] from a Care of Magical Creatures class and fed it fireworks.<ref name="COS8">{{COS|B|8}}</ref> This class may have been taught by Kettleburn, but this is not specified in the book. 
*In the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]] of [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]] and [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]], a [[Unidentified Hogwarts employees#White-bearded attendant|white-bearded wizard]] can be seen as a background extra in moments that take place at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. It is possible that this wizard could be Kettleburn. 
**The white-bearded extra is played by [[Nigel Anstey]], the grandfather of [[Tom Felton]], who played [[Draco Malfoy]] in all eight films.
*During the writing of {{POA}}, [[J. K. Rowling]] considered naming the new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[professor]] "[[Mylor Silvanus]]".<ref>"[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/sources/jkr.com/jkr-com-trans-jottings1.html More idle jottings (Page 1)]" on the Harry Potter Lexicon</ref> It is likely that this name was transferred over to Silvanus Kettleburn.
