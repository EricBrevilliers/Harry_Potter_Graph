==Etymology==
Lucy is a name of Latin origin, meaning "light". It is a feminine form of both Lucius and Luke; it is also a vernacular form of Lucia. The feast day of Saint Lucy (fourth century), patroness of sight, is called the Festival of Light in Sweden. Lucy can also be short for Lucille.

==Behind the scenes==
*Lucy's first name may be a tribute to Lucy Pevensie, a character from the ''Chronicles of Narnia'', written by one of J.K. Rowling's favourite authors, C.S. Lewis.
