==Biography==
After his retirement from the {{W|British Armed Forces}}, he apparently spent a lot of time with her, and was willing to do her favours.<ref name="POA2">{{POA|B|2}}</ref> He watched over [[Marjorie Dursley's eleven unidentified bulldogs|her dogs]] when she went to visit her [[Vernon Dursley|brother]] and his [[Dursley family|family]] in the summer of [[1993]] (excepting [[Ripper]], who [[Marjorie Dursley|Marge]] took along on the trip, as she said he couldn't stand to be parted from her).<ref name="POA2" />

The [[1992|year before]], he drowned one of Marge's pups at her request, as she considered it a "weak", "underbred", "ratty little thing". Marge also claimed to have accidentally shattered a [[wine]] glass on a visit to the Colonel's house the day before she left to visit her [[Vernon Dursley|brother]].<ref name="POA2" />

Marge was secretly in [[love]] with him, but her feelings were never requited due to their conflicts in personality.<ref name="pottermore">{{PM}}, [https://www.harrypotter.com/fact-file/characters-and-pets/marge-dursley Marge Dursley Fact File]</ref>
