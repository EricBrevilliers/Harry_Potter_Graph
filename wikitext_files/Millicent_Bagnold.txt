'''Minister Millicent Bagnold''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who served as the thirty-first [[Minister for Magic]] of the [[British Ministry of Magic]], in office from [[1980]] to [[1990]].<ref name="wombat">Sixth question of the Third [[Wizards' Ordinary Magic and Basic Aptitude Test|W.O.M.B.A.T.]] at {{JKRS}}</ref> Her tenure is most remembered for taking place during [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s first downfall, in [[1981]].<ref name="wombat"/><ref name="pottermore"/>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Bagnold was born in or prior to [[1963]].<ref name="birth"/> In her youth, she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where she was [[Sorting Ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw]] house.<ref name="pottermore">[[Pottermore introductions to Hogwarts Houses]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110818075027/http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/j-k-rowlings-pottermore-releases-backstories-and-history-of-four-hogwarts-houses-84167/ Archived here])</ref>

===As Minister for Magic {{C|1980–1990}}===
{{Quote|Famous Ravenclaw Ministers for Magic include Millicent Bagnold, who was in power on the night that Harry Potter survived the Dark Lord's curse, and defended the wizarding celebrations all over Britain with the words, 'I assert our inalienable right to party'.|[[Robert Hilliard]]|Pottermore}}
In [[1980]], at the height of the [[First Wizarding War]], Bagnold was [[Elections for British Minister of Magic|elected]] the [[Minister for Magic]] of [[Great Britain]].<ref name="wombat"/> [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Bartemius Crouch Snr]] was Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] during Ms Bagnold's term.<ref name="GF27">{{GOF|B|27}}</ref>

She was in power when, on the evening of [[31 October]] [[1981]], [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] went to [[Godric's Hollow]] to [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1981)|murder]] [[James Potter (I)|James]] and [[Lily Potter (I)|Lily Potter]], the destruction of [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s corporeal body, as well as the inadvertent creation of a [[Horcrux]], [[Harry Potter]]. The night that followed turned out to be the major upheaval of Bagnold's term in office since [[Wizardkind|wizards]] up and down the country started [[Fall of Lord Voldemort celebrations|celebrating Voldemort's downfall]] and the end of the [[First Wizarding War]] in what became "a night of large-scale breaches of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy|International Wizarding Statute of Secrecy]]"<ref name="wombat"/><ref name="PS1">{{PS|B|1}}</ref> Bagnold defended these celebrations by famously stating that she asserted the wizards' "inalienable right to party".<ref name="pottermore"/>

[[File:Wizengamot.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] trials before the [[Council of Magical Law]]]]
It was also during her term in office that [[Death Eaters]] [[Igor Karkaroff]], [[Rodolphus Lestrange (II)|Rodolphus]], [[Rabastan Lestrange|Rabastan]], [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], as well as [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Bartemius Crouch Jnr]] were rounded up and tried before the [[Council of Magical Law]] and sent to [[Azkaban]].<ref name="GF30">{{GOF|B|30}}</ref> [[Sirius Black]] was falsely accused to be one of Voldemort's supporters and one of those responsible for the murders of [[James Potter (I)|James]] and [[Lily Potter (I)|Lily Potter]] and was sent to [[Azkaban]] without a trial.<ref name="GF27"/>

====Daily businesses as Minister====
[[File:Millicent Bagnold attending Knarlenbarn HM3KBD.png|250px|thumb|left|Minister Bagnold attending Knarlenbarn in the Great Hall]]
During the [[1986–1987 school year]], Minister Bagnold visited [[Ollivanders]] in [[Diagon Alley]] to have [[Garrick Ollivander]] repair her [[wand]]. She was in a hurry that day, and did not want him to spend extra time testing out her wand. [[Jacob's sibling]] approached her in the shop and successfully asked her for a quick conversation, after they cleaned up some wands that Bagnold accidentally knocked on the floor. The student asked her to attend [[Knarlenbarn]] at Hogwarts, and to bring her pet [[Knarl]] [[Karl (Knarl)|Karl]] with her, in order to reunite him with his long-lost twin brother [[Knarl (individual)|Knarl]]. She agreed, and attended the event in the [[Great Hall]].<ref name="HM3KBD">{{HM|3|KNARL'S BIG DAY}}</ref>

In [[February]] [[1990]] or [[1991]] for [[Valentine's Day]], Bagnold announced the rules for the [[love]] essay competition hosted by the [[Hogwarts Express Railway Authorities|Hogwarts Express Railway Authority]] to Hogwarts student at [[Hogsmeade station]].<ref name="HM5TTL1">{{HM|5|TICKET TO LOVE|1}}</ref> Bagnold later declared Jacob's sibling the winner of the competition in the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]].<ref name="HM5TKL4">{{HM|5|TICKET TO LOVE|4}}</ref>

====Retirement====
After Bagnold's retirement in [[1990]], it was temporarily unclear who would succeed her. In the early [[1980s]], [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Bartemius Crouch Snr]] initially seemed most likely to succeed Bagnold, but his popularity was tarnished following the scandal in which he sent [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|his own son]] to [[Azkaban]].<ref name="GF27"/> [[Albus Dumbledore]] also had a lot of popular support to be her successor, but he never expressed any desire to take the Minister's job, so [[Cornelius Fudge]] took the post instead.<ref name="PS5">{{PS|B|5}}</ref><ref name="OP5">{{OOTP|B|5}}</ref>

===Later life===
On [[1 September]] [[1991]], [[Prefect]] [[Robert Hilliard]] welcomed the Ravenclaw [[First year|first-years]] to [[Ravenclaw Tower]] with a short speech in which he mentioned former Minister Millicent Bagnold as one of the many notable Hogwarts students who had been [[Sorting Ceremony|Sorted]], like them, into Ravenclaw.<ref name="pottermore"/>

In the spring of [[2021]], as [[The Unforgivable]] were seemingly harvesting [[Harry Potter]]'s traumatic memories to manifest as surges of the [[Calamity]], snippets of their own memories started to leak through to Harry as dreams. At one point, he started having recurring nightmares of Millicent Bagnold presiding over a [[Wizengamot]] trial, accusing someone of having a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] for a brother and half of their family in [[Azkaban]] for killing [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] and conspiring with [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]. [[Hermione Granger]] reached out to Bagnold but she said she presided over many such trials as Minister and could not recall any specific details: Hermione speculated that Bagnold's memory of that day might have been [[Memory Charm|tampered with]], but ultimately found it more likely "that her age [had] caught up with her".<ref name="WU">{{WU}} ([[Registry: Adversaries Events]])</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Millicent" is from the Germanic name ''Amalasuintha'', composed of the elements ''amal'' "work, labour" and ''swinþ'' "strength".

Her last name is probably derived from the English author and playwright {{W|Enid Bagnold}}.

==Behind the scenes==
*Bagnold's term in office was almost the same as the real world British [[Prime Minister]] {{W|Margaret Thatcher}}'s tenure ([[1979]]–[[1990]]).
*She shares the same first name and last initial as [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] [[Slytherin]] student [[Millicent Bulstrode]].
*Millicent was the [[Minister for Magic]] during the events of {{HM}} until [[Cornelius Fudge]] took over the job during the player's [[Year 7 in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery|seventh year]].
**In the "Ticket to Love" side quest available from [[Year 5 in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery|year five]] in {{HM}}, Millicent says she is a former Minister for Magic.<ref name="HM5TTL1"/> However, as year five takes place in the [[1988–1989 school year]], this must be an error, as Bagnold retired in 1990. It is therefore only really possible that this event happened chronologically in either [[Year 6 in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery|year 6]] (February 1990) or [[Year 7 in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery|year 7]] (February 1991) for this statement to be correct.
