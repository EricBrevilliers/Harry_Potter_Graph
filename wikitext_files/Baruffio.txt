And saying the magic words properly is very important, too — never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.|[[Filius Flitwick]] on the importance of [[Incantation|incanting]] correctly|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
'''Wizard'''<ref name="PS10" /><ref name="PM">{{PM}} - ''[[The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1]]''</ref> '''Baruffio''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] with a [[speech impediment]].<ref name="PS10french">{{PS|B|10}}; French translation</ref>

==Biography==
On account of his condition, he did not seem to have been able to perform particularly satisfactory [[magic]], as he would mispronounce the [[incantation]]s: once he said 's' instead of 'f' and conjured a [[buffalo]] on top of him,<ref name="PS10">{{PS|B|10}}</ref>

Baruffio was also known for the invention of the [[potion]] [[Baruffio's Brain Elixir]].<ref name="HL">{{HL}}</ref>

A [[portrait]] of Baruffio being sat upon by a buffalo could be found in [[Hogwarts Castle]] by [[1890]].<ref name="HL"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Despite the fact that Flitwick mentions Baruffio's incident while teaching Harry and the other first year students ''[[Levitation Charm|Wingardium Leviosa]]'', this could not have been the spell to which he was referring as there is no "f" in the Levitation Charm's incantation.
**However, Flitwick was probably mentioning a line in the introduction of ''[[The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1]]'' which mentions Baruffio.
*On the French translation of {{PS}} Baruffio's incident with a buffalo is slightly different. It introduces another character: Baruffio's wife. Quoting from the French translation: "''N'oubliez jamais le sorcier Baruffio qui avait un défaut de prononciation et dont la femme s'est retrouvée avec un bison sur les épaules au lieu d'un vison''". (Loosely translated: "''Remember wizard Baruffio who had a speech impediment and whose wife was left with a buffalo on her shoulders instead of a mink''".). The translator, [[Jean-François Ménard]], plays with the alliteration "''bison''"/"''vison''" ("buffalo"/"mink"). As it is usually women who wear furs, the introduction of a female character was necessary.
