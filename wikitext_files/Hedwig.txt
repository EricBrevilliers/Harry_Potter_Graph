{{Quote|Very smart owl you've got there.|[[Tom]] noting Hedwig's impressive intelligence|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
'''Hedwig''' (d. [[27 July]] [[1997]]) was [[Harry Potter]]'s pet female [[snowy owl]]. Hedwig was an eleventh birthday gift from [[Rubeus Hagrid]] to Harry. Hagrid purchased her at the [[Eeylops Owl Emporium]].<ref name="PS5"/>

In addition to delivering mail, the typical use [[owl]]s were put to, Hedwig was also a close companion to Harry. She remained one of his closest friends right up to her death during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] at the height of the [[Second Wizarding War]].

==Biography==
===Purchase===
{{Quote|Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing.|Harry Potter having brought Hedwig|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Hedwig.gif|250px|thumb|left|Hagrid holding Hedwig's cage]]
On [[31 July]] [[1991]], Hedwig was kept at the [[Eeylops Owl Emporium]] until she was purchased by [[Rubeus Hagrid]] while he was helping [[Harry Potter]] get school supplies in [[Diagon Alley]]. She was a [[Harry Potter's eleventh birthday|birthday]] present for Harry when he turned eleven. Harry was obviously delighted with his new pet and was very grateful to Hagrid. Harry and Hagrid purchased her from Eyelops Owl Emporium together. This was the first birthday present Harry had ever received, as the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] never celebrated his birthday. He very quickly grew attached to her.<ref name="PS5">{{PS|B|5}}</ref>

Harry decided to name her Hedwig after [[Hedwig (wizard)|an individual]] he saw mentioned in ''[[A History of Magic]]''. In the days before arriving for his [[first year]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], Harry avoided the Dursleys by staying in his room. Hedwig stayed with him during this time, his only friend at [[4 Privet Drive]].<ref name="PS6">{{PS|B|6}}</ref>

===Hogwarts years===
[[File:Giphy (17).gif|250px|thumb|Hedwig with Harry during his time at Hogwarts]]
Throughout her life, she fulfilled the traditional function of an owl by delivering mail for Harry. She spent her years at Hogwarts fulfilling her duties by getting and sending letters to many individuals. In 1991, Harry's first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, she would usually fly in during breakfast to nibble Harry's ear affectionately and have a bit of [[toast]] before going off to sleep in the [[Owlery]] with the other [[Hogwarts school owls|school owls]]. The first letter she ever gave him was from Rubeus Hagrid, who invited Harry to have a cup of tea with him and to hear all about his first week at school.<ref name="PS8">{{PS|B|8}}</ref> At one point, she was tasked with sending a letter to [[Charles Weasley]] in [[Romania]] asking if he could take [[Norberta]] the [[Norwegian Ridgeback]], Hagrid's temporary pet [[dragon]], to Romania.<ref name="PS14">{{PS|B|14}}</ref>

In the summer of [[1992]], Hedwig stayed with Harry at the Dursleys' in Privet Drive again. [[Vernon Dursley]] forced Harry to lock Hedwig in her cage, sometimes for weeks at a timem to prevent Harry from sending messages to his "freaky little friends". Hedwig started to grow bored and frustrated, a feeling Harry mirrored. He felt forgotten by his friends and mused that Hedwig was the only proof he had that the [[wizarding world]] was real.<ref name="CS1">{{COS|B|1}}</ref> 

[[File:Hedwig, Seamus, Ron and Harry Potter (1991).JPG|250px|thumb|left|Hedwig delivering mail to Harry during breakfast]]
When [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], [[Fred Weasley|Fred]], and [[George Weasley]], arrived to rescue Harry from Privet Drive in the [[Flying Ford Anglia]], he nearly ended up forgetting Hedwig when he was getting into the car. She noticed and hooted, waking Vernon up. Harry had to run to get her and put her in the car too. He later let her out, and Hedwig flew behind the car all the way to [[The Burrow]].<ref name="CS3">{{COS|B|3}}</ref> In subsequent summers, Hedwig's frustrated hooting convinced the Dursleys to allow Harry to let her out to fly on the condition that he didn't use her to send messages. However, Harry sometimes ignored this instruction.

[[File:HarryPotterInBedWithWandMaraudersMapAndHedwig Still.jpg|250px|thumb|Hedwig in the Gryffindor boys' dormitory for [[Third year|third-years]]]]
In the summer of [[1993]], she took longer to get back to Privet Drive because she decided to fly to [[Hermione Granger]] in [[France]] to get her birthday gift for Harry. On her way back, she had to help [[Errol]] get Ron's gift to Harry when he collapsed. She later went back to Hermione to deliver Harry's letter to her. In her absence, Harry abandoned Privet Drive and went to the [[Leaky Cauldron]]. Hedwig, being very intelligent, knew the place she needed to go and arrived at the pub a few minutes earlier than he did. 

In the build-up to the [[Second Wizarding War]], Hedwig was constrained in what she could do for Harry due to the fact that snowy owls weren't native to Britain, which made her conspicuous. This could potentially raise suspicions if onlookers witnessed a snowy owl always going back and forth from a specific location. A specific instance of this was during [[Sirius Black]]'s evasion of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in [[1994]]. Hedwig was keen to deliver messages, but Harry refused to put her at risk, leading to a minor falling out between them.

[[File:Hedwig 1994.gif|250px|thumb|left|Hedwig preparing to deliver a message to [[Sirius Black]] in 1994]]
In [[1995]], Hedwig was attacked by [[Dolores Umbridge]] or her associates in an effort to intercept Harry's mail, requiring [[Dobby]] and [[Professor]] [[Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank]] to nurse her back to health.<ref name="OOTP13">{{OOTP|B|13}}</ref> [[Lavender Brown]] once admitted to [[Parvati Patil]] that she always loved Hedwig and thought her to be so beautiful.<ref name="OOTP17">{{OOTP|B|17}}</ref> In [[1996]], Hedwig brought Harry a brand new copy of ''[[Advanced Potion-Making]]'' from [[Flourish and Blotts]], which was intended as a replacement for the [[Severus Snape's copy of Advanced Potion-Making|Half-Blood Prince's copy]], but he did not use it nonetheless.<ref name="HBP11">{{HBP|B|11}}</ref>

===Death and post-mortem===
{{Quote|No... ''NO!'' Hedwig... Hedwig...|Hedwig's death causing Harry much grief|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
Hedwig was killed on [[27 July]] [[1997]] during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]. While aboard Hagrid's [[Sirius Black's motorbike|flying motorcycle]] with Harry she was struck by a [[Killing Curse]], possibly aimed at Hagrid. She was killed instantly and fell like a rag doll to the bottom of her cage. To add insult to the injury of losing his much-loved companion, Harry was then forced to destroy the sidecar containing Hedwig's body in an effort to slow down the pursuing [[Death Eaters]].<ref name="DH4">{{DH|B|4}}</ref> 

Harry was devastated by the loss of Hedwig. His friends were naturally deeply sympathetic and tried to comfort him. Hagrid consoled him by saying that Hedwig had lived "a great old life".<ref name="DH5">{{DH|B|5}}</ref>

Following the [[Second Wizarding War]], Harry continued to keep a snowy owl to honour her.<ref name="honour">https://stories.jkrowling.com/harrypotter/#question-6</ref> During the [[Calamity]] which happened across the [[wizarding world]] in the late [[2010s]] and early [[2020s]], a mysterious [[Foundable]] of Hedwig's memory appeared throughout the world, which was trapped in a [[Atmospheric Charm|whirlwind]] [[Confoundable]]. Volunteer [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] could free Hedwig by casting the [[counter-charm]] ''[[meteolojinx recanto]]'' to cancel the effects of the wind and enable Hedwig's memory to return to its rightful place.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Hedwig's large round amber eyes gazed reproachfully at him over the dead frog clamped in her beak... In addition to every other miserable feeling, he now felt guilty that he'd been irritable with Hedwig; she was the only friend he had at [[4 Privet Drive|number four, Privet Drive]].|Hedwig's displeasure at Harry's treatment of her|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Hedwig was a very intelligent, loyal, and affectionate companion, and tended to show her affection by gently nibbling [[Harry Potter]]'s ears or fingers. She also demonstrated that she was fully capable of understanding his wishes and would faithfully follow his orders, such as when he instructed her to find and peck [[Ronald Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] to prompt them to write to him during the summer holidays. Hedwig obeyed Harry's requests, and even pecked Ron and Hermione on Harry's orders in order to get them to write back to him.<ref name="OP5">{{OOTP|B|5}}</ref>

Hedwig was a dignified and proud creature and was disapproving of less mature [[owl]]s, such as Ron Weasley's [[Pigwidgeon]].<ref name="GF3">{{GOF|B|3}}</ref> She responded to the hyperactive behaviour she considered inappropriate by staring or hooting reproachfully. She would sometimes show her displeasure physically, turning her back on Harry (showing him her tail), cuffing him with a wing, or even nipping him a little harder than usual if she was offended. 

In particular, she seemed disdainful when Harry had to stop using her to deliver messages to [[Sirius Black]] to avoid suspicion, which briefly affected their friendship. Hedwig would also make a lot of noise if she was locked in her cage for too long.<ref name="csfilm">{{COS|F}}</ref> 

Hedwig was a very intelligent owl. When Ron, [[Fred Weasley|Fred]], and [[George Weasley]] came to rescue Harry from the Dursleys in their [[Flying Ford Anglia]], she was still and silent so as to not wake up the Dursleys. She also screeched loudly to alert Harry when he almost forgot to take her with him into the car.<ref name="CS3">{{COS|B|3}}</ref> Her intelligence also once made her decide to fly to [[France]] to get Hermione's thirteenth birthday present to Harry while she was on holiday. Harry relocated to the [[Leaky Cauldron]] during Hedwig's journey, but she still knew where to find him. According to [[Tom]], the landlord, she arrived five minutes before Harry did.

Further evidence of Hedwig's resourcefulness was found in the fact that she didn't need a specific address to deliver messages - a name alone was sufficient. Hedwig was a keen hunter too and, when possible, was allowed to fly outside free and catch food for herself, such as [[frog]]s.<ref name="OP3">{{OOTP|B|3}}</ref> She would also eat [[Eeylops Premium Owl Treats]].

==Etymology==
[[J. K. Rowling]] found the name St Hedwig in a book of medieval saints.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060316221406/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=76 J.K. Rowling Official Site - F.A.Q. (archived via Wayback Machine)]</ref> It's derived from Hedvig - a Scandinavian name meaning female warrior or battle.<ref>http://pagannames.witchipedia.com/hedvig</ref> There are two female saints named Hedwig:

*Saint {{w|Hedwig of Andechs}} (1174–1243), Duchess of {{W|Silesia}}, who is the patron saint of orphans.
*Saint {{w|Hedwig of Poland|Hedwig (Jadwiga)}} (1373–1399), Queen (officially King) of Poland.

A St Hedwig's Day dedicated to Hedwig of Andechs has been observed on [[October]] 16th every year since she was canonised in 1267.

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|I made a few elementary mistakes when it came to my depiction of Hedwig. Firstly, Snowy Owls are diurnal (ie, they fly by day). Secondly, they are virtually mute, so Hedwig’s frequent hoots and chirrups of approval and comfort should be taken as signs of her magically enhanced abilities. Thirdly, as countless well-meaning owl-lovers and experts kept writing to me in the early days, owls do not eat bacon (Hedwig enjoys a bit of bacon rind when she delivers post at breakfast).|J.K. Rowling|Pottermore}} 
[[File:Female Snowy Owl.jpg|100px|thumb|right|A real-life female snowy owl]]
[[File:Hedwig_Plush.png|thumb|Hedwig plush from {{WWHP}}]]
*The death of Hedwig symbolised Harry's loss of innocence as he came of age.<ref>[http://www.bloomsbury.com/harrypotter/default.aspx?sec=3 Bloomsbury Live Chat]</ref>
*In the {{HPbooks}}, [[J. K. Rowling]] writes that Hedwig ''hoots'', but, in real life, snowy owls actually ''bark''. The fact was pointed out to Rowling after the publishing of {{PS}}. She admitted her mistake, but decided to leave Hedwig's vocalisation as a ''hoot'' in the latter books for continuity.
*In the [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]], Hedwig is played by [[Gizmo]],<ref>''[http://www2.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=5802 Meet Gary Gero, Animal Trainer for Two Harry Potter Movies]''</ref> and his main stunt replacements, [[Ook]] and [[Sprout (owl)|Sprout]].<ref>''[http://www.mugglenet.com/movies/movie1/trivia.shtml First Movie Trivia]''</ref> Further owls were [[Kasper]], [[Swoops]], [[Oh Oh]], [[Elmo]], and [[Bandit]].
**Since the owls who played Hedwig were almost all male, her appearance in the films is that of a male snowy owl, not a female one, as a female would have more dark spots. The choice of using male owls was because they are smaller and therefore easier for young actors to handle.
**[[Ook]] was the first cast member to be chosen for a role in {{PS|FA}}.<ref>{{wikilink|Ook|lang=pt}}</ref> 
*A Hedwig plush is available for purchase at {{WWHP}}.
*In {{PS|FA}}, Hedwig delivers the [[Nimbus 2000]] [[broomstick]], purchased by [[Minerva McGonagall]], to Harry. In the book, however, six [[screech owl]]s delivered it, not Hedwig.
*Rowling originally intended to make Hedwig open Harry's [[Golden Snitch]] in ''Deathly Hallows''.<ref>"[http://harryahistory.com/2008/08/hedwig-owl-of-a-different-fate.html Hedwig: Owl of a Different Fate?]" on the ''Harry, A History'' site</ref> She considers [[snowy owl]]s to be "the most beautiful [[owl]] of all," ergo her choice in Hedwig's colour.
*"[[Hedwig's Theme]]" is the musical leitmotif associated with Hedwig. Composed by [[John Williams]], it's percieved by many to be the Main Theme of the ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter films]]'' and is featured in some form or another in many other tracks throughout the franchise.
*A deleted scene in {{COS|FA}} shows Harry asking Hedwig "''Who am I, Hedwig? What am I?''" after he learns that he is able to speak [[Parseltongue]].<ref name="comparison">[http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=4087653 Movie-Censorship.com - Comparison - Theatrical Version / Ultimate Edition - ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']</ref>
*In {{POA|FA}}, when Harry arrives at the [[Leaky Cauldron]], Tom the barman refers to Hedwig as 'he'.
*Hedwig appears as a playable character in the console versions of the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|''Prisoner of Azkaban'' video game]].
[[File:Death Eater kills Hedwig.gif|250px|thumb|right|Hedwig's death in {{DH|F1}}]]
*In the film {{DH|F1}}, Hedwig dies when she tries to protect Harry and Hagrid from a [[Hedwig's killer|Death Eater's]] attacks, being hit with a [[Killing Curse]] and her lifeless body spiralling down to the ground while all Harry could do was watch in grief. Hedwig was allowed to fly free behind Harry during the sequence, and her attempt to protect Harry and Hagrid was key in allowing the [[Death Eaters]] to identify him as the real [[Harry Potter]]. Her death in the film contradicts her death in the book, where she was killed by a stray Killing Curse whilst kept in her cage.
*In the {{TCG}}, [[Hedwig (Trading Card)|Hedwig]] is listed as a [[Gryffindor]]. No other creatures (excluding the house emblems) have [[Hogwarts Houses]] in the game, not even [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]], who actually attended Hogwarts and was sorted into Gryffindor.
*On [[17 August]] [[2009]], ''[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/ The Telegraph]'' [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/harry-potter/6042159/Owl-crop-circle-appears-in-Wiltshire-field.html reported] that a new series of mysterious crop-circles (patterns cut in farmers fields) had appeared on that summer in fields in [[Wiltshire]], and the most recent was the 400 foot pattern, which they noted as perhaps a tribute to the late Hedwig from the [[Harry Potter (book series)|''Harry Potter'' series]].<ref>''[http://the-leaky-cauldron.org/2009/8/17/who-cast-the-owl-crop-circle-spell Who Cast the Owl Crop Circle Spell?]''</ref>
*The site Mugglenet.com released a book titled ''[http://www.amazon.com/MuggleNet-coms-What-Happen-Harry-Potter/dp/B002ACPMF4 MuggleNet.com's What Will Happen in Harry Potter 7: Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Falls in Love and How Will the Adventure Finally End?]'' In the book, they gave odds as to which characters would live and which would be killed off, but did not include odds for Hedwig. After the release of {{DH}}, they posted the results of the odds on their website, and also listed Hedwig with 1/1000 and the note "Just kidding."<ref name="scorecard">[https://web.archive.org/web/20131030195224/http://www.mugglenet.com/dhscorecard.shtml ''Deathly Hallows'' Scorecard- Mugglenet] (via the Internet Archive)</ref>
*Hedwig makes an appearance in {{HM}} in Volume 1, Chapter 1 of Beyond Hogwarts, in which she listens to Hagrid talking with [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Penny Haywood]] after being purchased by Hagrid alone and before being delivered to Harry when he finishes buying [[Harry Potter's wand|his wand]] from [[Ollivanders]]. This lines up with {{PS|FA}}, but not the book, in which Hagrid and Harry bought Hedwig first and then went to Ollivanders together.
*In the "Harry's Birthday" special event in {{MA}}, Harry reminisces about Hedwig with a [[Tiburon Merriweather's great-grandchild|Muggle-born Hogwarts student]] and explains to them that she sacrificed herself to protect him from a [[Killing Curse]]. This lines up with {{DH|F1}}, but not the book, in which she remained within her cage during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], inside which she was struck and killed by a Killing Curse intended for either Harry or Hagrid before Harry was forced to destroy the sidecar containing her body in order to slow down pursuing [[Death Eaters]].
