'''Augustus Pye''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and [[Trainee Healer]] at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] in the [['Dangerous' Dai Llewellyn Ward: Serious Bites|Dai Llewellyn Ward]].<ref name="OOTP22">{{OOTP|B|22}}</ref> He was interested in [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] healing techniques, and used [[stitches]] on [[Arthur Weasley]] when he was admitted to the hospital after he was [[Attack on Arthur Weasley|attacked]] by [[Nagini]]. Presumably, [[Nagini's venom]] made Arthur's wounds impossible to heal in this manner.<ref name="OOTP23">{{OOTP|B|23}}</ref>

During the [[Calamity]], Pye taught trainee [[Magizoologist]]s how to master the [[Stamina Charm]] to help them restore stamina to themselves in combat. He also met with a [[Calamity Investigator]] working for the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] and gave them suggestions to improve their [[Healing Potion]] involving a blend of magical and Muggle techniques. Despite the strangeness of Pye's suggestions, the investigator kept an open mind and implemented his ideas, successfully improving the effectiveness of their Healing Potion.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Augustus" means "great" or "venerable", derived from Latin augere "to increase". Augustus was the title given to Octavian, the first Roman emperor. He was the adopted son of Julius Caesar who rose to power through a combination of military skill and political prowess. This was also the name of three kings of Poland.
