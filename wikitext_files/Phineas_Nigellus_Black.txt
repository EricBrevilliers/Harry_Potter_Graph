He was able to travel between both portraits, allowing him to play a contributing role during the [[Second Wizarding War]].<ref name="OOTP22"/>

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[File:Phineas Nigellus.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Phineas Nigellus, as depicted in the [[Black Family Tapestry|Black family tree tapestry]]]]
Phineas Nigellus was born to the [[House of Black]] in [[1847]]. He had three siblings; [[Sirius Black (I)|Sirius]], [[Elladora Black|Elladora]], and [[Iola Black]].<ref name="family"/>

The siblings were raised in a household that strongly believed in the importance of [[Blood status|blood purity]], and as such Phineas carried a grudge against [[Muggle-born]]s, whom he called "[[Mudblood]]s" and considered "simple".<ref name="DH33">{{DH|B|33}}</ref><ref name="DH15">{{DH|B|15}}</ref>

At the age of eleven, circa [[1858]], Phineas Nigellus began his schooling at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where he was [[Sorting Ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]. He was once reprimanded by [[Dinah Hecat]] for having eaten a [[Sugar Quill]] in the middle of a lecture.<ref name="At Hogwarts">{{HL}} {{See video|url=https://youtu.be/Q7Q-v4lawLY?t=16118}}</ref>

Some time after leaving school circa [[1865]], Phineas Nigellus married [[Ursula Flint]], and at the age of 30, the two had a son, [[Sirius Black (II)|Sirius]], named after his deceased brother. Four more children followed: [[Phineas Black|Phineas]], who did not inherit his father's views on [[pure-blood]] supremacy and was disowned by the family for supporting [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] rights; [[Arcturus Black (II)|Arcturus]], [[Belvina Black|Belvina]] and [[Cygnus Black (II)|Cygnus]].<ref name="family"/> He was reportedly quite distant from his children, seldom visiting or speaking to them;<ref name="HL-letter"/> that said, he still ensured that they were financially cared for.

===As Headmaster of Hogwarts===
{{Quote|There's Phineas Nigellus... my great-great-grandfather, see? ... least popular Headmaster Hogwarts ever had.|[[Sirius Black]] on Phineas's legacy as Hogwarts Headmaster|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
As an adult, Black became a [[professor]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], a job which he loathed due to the impertinence of his students.<ref name="OOTP23">{{OOTP|B|23}}</ref> He was later appointed as the [[Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Headmaster]] of Hogwarts by the [[British Ministry of Magic]], but accepted the position only for the prestige and benefits associated with it and otherwise showed very little interest in acting as a role model or actively shaping children's education.<ref name="black-legacy">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiokqoTsCFo Headmaster Black's Legacy | Hogwarts Legacy (Simon Pegg Reveal)]</ref><ref name="AMHL">{{AMHL}} {{See image|File:Phineas Nigellus Black details - AMHL.jpeg}}</ref> While he was Headmaster, his two sons [[Sirius Black (II)|Sirius]] and [[Phineas Black|Phineas]] both attended Hogwarts.<ref name="HL-letter"/>

Before the [[1890–1891 school year]], the Ministry charged Black with arranging the arrival of a [[Unidentified 19th-century Hogwarts student|Hogwarts student]] who would be starting late as a [[Fifth year|fifth-year]]. As the [[Deputy Headmaster|Deputy Headmistress]] [[Matilda Weasley]] insisted that the student would need a mentor to be prepared for their enrolment, he [[Phineas Nigellus Black's letter to Eleazar Fig|assigned the task]] to Professor [[Eleazar Fig]].<ref name="Letter">{{HL}} {{See image|File:Phineas Nigellus Black's letter to Eleazar Fig.png}}</ref> He also worked with the [[Department of Magical Education]] to secure a [[Wizard's Field Guide]] to help them with their studies.<ref name="WTH"/>

[[File:Fig and player meeting Headmaster Black HL.png|250px|thumb|left|Professor Black meeting Professor Fig and the new fifth-year student outside the Great Hall]]
On [[1 September]] [[1890]], Black oversaw the [[Sorting Ceremony]]. After the last [[First year|first-year]] student was sorted, he noticed Fig watching from outside the [[Great Hall]] and went to meet him as well as the new fifth-year. He informed Fig that the ceremony was over and stopped Fig from telling him about [[goblin]]s, which he regarded as mere rumours. He nevertheless allowed the student to be sorted and led them into the hall.<ref name="WTH">{{HL|Welcome to Hogwarts}}</ref>

[[File:Headmaster Black talking about banning Quidditch HL.png|250px|thumb|right|Professor Black telling the students his decision of banning Quidditch]]
After it was done, Black announced that the year's [[Quidditch]] season was cancelled due to a [[Unidentified pure-blood student|student]] (in truth a [[pure-blood]])<ref name="PP">{{HL|The Polyjuice Plot}}</ref> having been injured in the previous spring's final. This elicited noticeable dissatisfaction among the students, but he reminded them that they were there to focus on their academic futures before hurrying them off to prepare for the next day's classes. He then asked Professor Weasley to show the new fifth-year to their [[common room]].<ref name="WTH"/> Later during the year, he ordered [[Gladwin Moon]] to remove the bells from the school's [[Bell Towers]] under the pretense that their sound gave him headaches, though rumour had it that he did not like hearing them because it reminded him of his wedding day.<ref name="HLAWTEB">{{HL|All's Well That Ends Bell}}</ref> His decision to cancel the Quidditch season was received very badly by many in the school, most notably [[Imelda Reyes]] and Madam [[Chiyo Kogawa]], the latter of whom would continually pester Black throughout the school year to get it reinstated.<ref name="PP" />

[[File:Headmaster Black summoning Professor Fig HL.png|250px|thumb|left|Professor Black summoning Professor Fig from his office]]
Throughout the school year, Black remained oblivious while countless world-threatening developments occurred around him, such as [[Ranrok]]'s planned invasion of the school.<ref name="THS">{{HL|The Headmistress Speaks}}</ref><ref name="TFR">{{HL|The Final Repository}}</ref> He peremptorily occupied Professor Fig's time when he was about to visit the [[Hogwarts Library|library]] with the new fifth-year student,<ref name="SRS">{{HL|Secrets of the Restricted Section}}</ref> asking him to go to [[London]] to talk to the [[Minister for Magic]] about [[George Osric]]'s death.<ref name="TT">{{HL|Tomes and Tribulations}}</ref> When the new fifth-year student needed to use [[Polyjuice Potion]] to disguise as Black and obtain the password to the [[Headmaster's office]], Fig asked Black to meet a liaison at [[Hogsmeade]] to draw him away,<ref name="PP"/> during which Black became inebriated rather quickly.<ref name="NFT">{{HL|Niamh Fitzgerald's Trial}}</ref>

[[File:Headmaster Black toasting Professor Fig HL.png|250px|thumb|right|Professor Black leading a toast for Professor Fig]]
When Ranrok eventually did invade, with the aim of obtaining the [[final repository]] and supplanting [[wizardkind]] with [[goblin]]kind, Black was not present at the [[Battle for the final repository|battle that ensued]]. Black led an awkward and flippant tribute to Professor Fig, who had [[death|died]] in the battle, at his [[Memorial ceremony for Eleazar Fig|memorial ceremony]] in the [[Great Hall]],<ref name="TFR"/> and notably, he was reluctant even to appreciate the sheer heroism and skill of the new fifth-year student who had taken down Ranrok personally.<ref name="THC">{{HL|The House Cup}}</ref>

[[File:Scrope cleaning a bust of Phineas Nigellus Black HL.png|150px|thumb|left|[[Scrope]] cleaning a bust of Phineas Nigellus Black in the [[Faculty Tower]]]]
Black was known to weave his pure-blood supremacist values into the administration of the school. In his role, he attempted to persuade [[Minister for Magic|Minister]] [[Faris Spavin]] to change the Hogwarts admissions process, very likely to favour pure-bloods and restrict [[Muggle-born]]s, though his request was declined.<ref>{{HL}} {{See video|url=https://youtu.be/4IB6P6SAbJE?t=122}}</ref> On another occasion, he failed to [[Discipline at Hogwarts|discipline]] two students who were bullying a [[half-blood]] victim, claiming that "''the wise [[rabbit]] doesn't seek to outrun the [[tortoise]] – because it's not necessary.''"<ref name="rabbit-tortoise">{{HL}} {{See video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-b5LGhqizY}}</ref> His bigotry was fairly well-known, as students throughout the school could be heard claiming that he hated anybody who was not a pure-blood Slytherin.<ref name="HL">{{HL}}</ref>

In general, much of his work, whether it was administrative or related to student safety, was overtaken by Professor Weasley,<ref name="WTH"/><ref name="TFR"/> while he preferred to be Headmaster only for the rewards it brought to his social position.<ref name="black-legacy"/> His great-great-grandson, [[Sirius Black|Sirius Black (III)]], would later describe him as the least popular Head the school had ever known.<ref name="OOTP6"/> A [[book of Hogwarts Quidditch records]] found in the [[Hogwarts Library|school library]] also had Professor Black called a "prat" for cancelling Quidditch.<ref name="MA BBB 2">{{MA|Beaters, Bludgers, & Broomsticks|2}}</ref>

===Death and post-mortem===
{{Quote|We are honour-bound to give service to the present Headmaster of Hogwarts! Shame on you, Phineas!|[[Armando Dippet]]'s portrait to a sleepy Phineas|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Professor Black died in [[1925]] at age 78. At the time of his death, Phineas Nigellus had five children, at least thirteen grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.<ref name="family"/> Many more would be born after he had died.

Black's portrait in the [[Headmaster's office]] did not seem to enjoy assisting [[Albus Dumbledore]], believing that he was eccentric.<ref name="DH15"/> The second portrait of Black was hung at [[12 Grimmauld Place]], and like other portrait subjects in the wizarding world, Black could travel between his portraits, which he did often.<ref name="OOTP22">{{OOTP|B|22}}</ref>

In [[1995]], [[Harry Potter]] stayed in the bedroom where Black's portrait was hung, and Black passed him messages from Dumbledore.<ref name="OOTP23">{{OOTP|B|23}}</ref> His voice could sometimes be heard coming from the frame when he was not in it, making sarcastic comments. His portrait had also been trained to ridicule those with [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] parentage.<ref name="DH33"/><ref name="DH15"/> One of the main messages that Black passed was when his great-grandson [[Arthur Weasley]] was attacked by [[Nagini]] whilst on duty for the [[Order of the Phoenix]], letting [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] know he was going to have company.<ref name="OOTP22"/>

{{Dialogue a-b|Phineas Nigellus Black|I can't see why the boy should be able to do it better than you, Dumbledore.|Albus Dumbledore|I wouldn't expect you to, Phineas.|Black about [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s mission to [[Harry Potter]] to retrieve the [[Horcrux]] memory from [[Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Phineas Nigellus Black.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Dumbledore talking with Black's portrait]]
During [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]]'s quest to destroy [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Horcrux]]es, Black's Grimmauld Place portrait was hidden in Hermione's [[Extension Charm|magically enlarged]] [[Hermione Granger's beaded handbag|beaded bag]] to stop him from being able to report their location to [[Severus Snape]], then Headmaster of Hogwarts. His portrait was then taken with the trio when they left the house.<ref name="DH12">{{DH|B|12}}</ref>

During this time, Black reluctantly dropped certain snippets of information on what was going on in Hogwarts to them, aiding them in their quest. He managed to find out where they were camping and informed Snape, who was able to give them the [[Sword of Gryffindor]].<ref name="DH33"/> He appeared happier to help Snape than he was when helping Dumbledore, proud to help another Slytherin Headmaster.

Black possibly watched the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]]. After Voldemort's defeat, he saw Harry, Ron, and Hermione at the Headmaster's office. Like all the Headmaster portraits, he celebrated Hogwarts's victory, and proudly brought up the fact that Slytherin House had contributed to it.<ref name="DH36">{{DH|B|36}}</ref> He very likely would have continued to help future Headteachers after the [[Second Wizarding War]].

In [[2019]], Black's portrait was captured by the [[Calamity]] and began to appear around the world as a [[Foundable]].<ref name="WU">{{WU}}, "[[Brilliant Event: Fighting Forces]]"</ref>

==Physical description==
{{Quote|When the clever-looking wizard continued to feign sleep, some of them shouted his name too.|Brief description|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Professor Black was a clever-looking wizard, with black hair, "shrewd, narrow" dark<ref name="eyes">{{DH|B|15}} - 'A black blindfold appeared over Phineas Nigellus's clever, dark eyes, causing him to bump into the frame and shriek with pain.'</ref> eyes,<ref name="OOTP37">{{OOTP|B|37}}</ref> a pointed beard and thin eyebrows. He was depicted posthumously in his portrait as wearing the green and silver colours associated with Slytherin House.<ref name="OOTP22"/> He also wore a hat.<ref>{{DH|B|15}} - 'Only the edge of his hat brim remained in view when Harry gave a sudden shout.'</ref>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Never try to understand the students. They hate it. They would much rather be tragically misunderstood, wallow in self-pity, stew in their own —|Phineas Nigellus Black's portrait|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:PhineasNBlack.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Black's portrait]]
In his portrait form, Black was shown to be a snide, sarcastic individual. He had little patience for the feelings and problems of others, particularly young people, whom he found tedious and self-absorbed, and had no qualms whatsoever in using demeaning phrases when referring to others.<ref name="DH15"/><ref name="black-legacy"/><ref name="OOTP37"/> He did however show respect towards certain individuals, such as [[Severus Snape]]. He also acknowledged [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s skills despite generally disagreeing with him. He also seemed to support [[Blood status|blood purity]], since he looked down on [[Muggle-born]]s and even used the pejorative term "[[Mudblood]]".<ref name="DH15"/> Black even harboured a hatred for [[half-blood]]s, considering [[Mundungus Fletcher]] to be "''manky''".<ref name="HBP13"/>

Despite his views on blood purity, he did not support the [[Death Eaters]] and celebrated with the other portraits when [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] was finally defeated.<ref name="DH36"/> He seemed sentimental of the Black family possessions, as he was quite dismayed upon learning that Mundungus was stealing and selling them.<ref name="HBP13"/> He also seemed to care for his family members, even ones who were disowned, as he was upset at learning about the death of his great-great-grandson, [[Sirius Black]].<ref name="OOTP37"/> He appeared to hold many of the qualities that are fitting of [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]: cleverness, ambition, cunning, self-preservation, determination and pride.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Charms]]''': Black was adept at casting the [[Freezing Spell]], and did so on at least one occasion to extinguish a [[fire]] caused by three Slytherin students at Hogwarts.<ref name="rabbit-tortoise"/>

==Relationships==
===Family===
{{Quote|Probably another message for my worthless [[Sirius Black|great-great-grandson]].|Phineas Nigellus Black commenting on the only [[Sirius Black|member]] of his [[House of Black|family]] he was known to dislike|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Phineas Nigellus Black's older brother, [[Sirius Black (I)|Sirius]], died in childhood. He had two sisters: [[Elladora Black|Elladora]], who began the family tradition of beheading aged [[House-elf|house-elves]], and [[Iola Black|Iola]], who was disowned for marrying the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Bob Hitchens]].

[[File:BlackTapestryHarrySirius.jpg|250px|thumb|Phineas Nigellus's great-great-grandson [[Sirius Black|Sirius]], last of the Blacks, standing in front of the Black family tree]]
Black was married to [[Ursula Flint]]. They had five children: [[Sirius Black (II)|Sirius]], [[Phineas Black|Phineas]], [[Cygnus Black (II)|Cygnus]], [[Belvina Black|Belvina]], and [[Arcturus Black (II)|Arcturus]]. Phineas was disowned for supporting Muggle rights, showing that Phineas Nigellus valued [[pure-blood supremacy]] over his relationships with close family members.

Phineas Nigellus was reportedly quite distant and neglectful toward his wife and children, rarely visiting or speaking with them.<ref name="HL-letter">{{HL}} ([[Ursula Black's letter to Phineas Nigellus Black]])</ref> Nonetheless, he fulfilled his duties as a provider, ensuring they were financially supported.

Though Black did not get along well with most people, his portrait was upset to learn that his great-great-grandson [[Sirius Black|Sirius]], the last of the surname Black, was dead in [[1996]],<ref name="OOTP37"/> and was visibly upset when he learned that [[Mundungus Fletcher]] was stealing Black family heirlooms the following year.<ref name="HBP13"/> This could have been from dynastic or emotional reasons.

===Albus Dumbledore===
{{Quote|You know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts ... but you cannot deny he's got style ...|Black's portrait to [[Cornelius Fudge]]|Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix}}
[[File:Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Albus Dumbledore]], his student and later successor]]
Black was Headmaster during [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s years as a student at Hogwarts, but Black did not seem to hold much respect for his former student and distant successor. While others, including [[Harry Potter]] and [[Rubeus Hagrid]], considered Dumbledore the greatest sorcerer in the world, Black considered him to be too eccentric and to be wasting his time by trying to understand the students.<ref name="DH15"/><ref name="OOTP23"/> Dumbledore, however, always took Black's criticisms lightly.<ref name="HBP17"/> Although Black was trained to advise future Headmasters, he was known to despise advising Albus Dumbledore.

Black's opinion of the man went on even after Dumbledore's self-planned death at the hands of [[Severus Snape]] in [[1997]], and he proceeded to admire Snape, who later became Headmaster himself, considerably more.

However, after Dumbledore escaped from being arrested by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in [[1996]], Black commented to [[Cornelius Fudge]] that, although he disagreed with Dumbledore on many accounts, one couldn't deny that he had style.<ref name="OOTP27">{{OOTP|B|27}}</ref> This may indicate that Black had a little bit of admiration for Dumbledore.

===Severus Snape===
[[File:Severus Snape.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Severus Snape]], a Slytherin whom he respected as Headmaster]]
{{Dialogue a-b|Phineas Nigellus Black|Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The Mudblood —|Severus Snape|Do not use that word!|Black revealing the whereabouts of [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] to Professor Snape|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
Any relationship with Black before [[Severus Snape]] became Headmaster of Hogwarts School is unknown, but by the time that Snape was appointed to the post in [[1997]], Black came to greatly admire Snape, who was the first Head of the school to have once been in [[Slytherin]] since he himself had presided over the castle. Whenever others would insult Snape, Black would immediately end the conversation, although this disliking of anyone who insulted the subject of his respect did not carry so far as to stop other factors, such as curiosity, from refusing to speak to them indefinitely.

Snape himself, however, resented Black's tendency towards slurs directed at Muggle-borns, immediately demanding that Black never use the term "Mudblood" after Black let the phrase slip in Snape's presence.<ref name="DH33"/>

===Hogwarts students===
[[File:Harry Potter (HBP promo) 3.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Harry Potter]], a Gryffindor student]]
{{Quote|You know, this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher! Young people are so infernally convinced that they are right about everything.|Phineas Nigellus Black|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Despite being Headmaster, Black was known to dislike most of the students of Hogwarts and had no real ambition to be seen as a role model or any interest in the students' education.<ref name="black-legacy"/> This was possibly a reason why [[Sirius Black]] believed he was the least popular Headmaster Hogwarts ever had.<ref name="OOTP6"/> He believed that the young people didn't respect the professors enough, something that he told [[Albus Dumbledore]] when [[Harry Potter]] wanted to learn why it was so important to take [[Horace Slughorn]]'s memory.<ref name="HBP13">{{HBP|B|13}}</ref>

Furthermore, when Harry tried to convince Dumbledore that both [[Draco Malfoy]] and [[Severus Snape]] were loyal Death Eaters, Black said that young people believed that they were right about everything.<ref name="HBP17">{{HBP|B|17}}</ref> However, Black might have had a good relationship with the [[Slytherin]] students, whom he described as brave, but not stupid.<ref name="OOTP23"/>

==Possessions ==
*'''[[Phineas Nigellus Black's wand|Wand]]''': Black owned an ornate black-and-silver wand which he likely obtained from [[Ollivanders]] at the age of eleven, along with most other [[Great Britain|British]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Wizardkind|witches and wizards]].<ref name="AMHL"/>
*'''[[Scrope]]''': Scrope was a [[house-elf]] whose sole allegiance was to Phineas Nigellus Black. Scrope was inherited from Phineas's ancestor, [[Apollonia Black]], whom he had served before. Scrope attended Phineas during his tenure as [[Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts Headteacher]].<ref name="PP"/>
*'''[[Phineas Nigellus Black's Niffler|Niffler]]''': Black owned a pet [[Niffler]].<ref name="AMHL"/>
*'''[[Niamh Fitzgerald's book]]''': This was a book stored in the [[Headmaster's office]] during Black's tenure, which allowed a [[Unidentified 19th-century Hogwarts student|student]] with the power of [[ancient magic]] to enter into [[Niamh Fitzgerald]]'s trial.<ref name="NFT"/>

==Etymology==
''Phineas'' is the English form of the name Phinehas<ref>{{Wtlink|Phineas#Etymology|Phineas}}</ref>, used in some English copies of the Old Testament. According to the Bible, Phinehas was a priest during the Israelites' journey to the Exodus, the grandson of Aaron and son of Eleazar, the High Priests. Some theorise that its meaning is "serpent's mouth" in Hebrew, something that fits in with the fact that Phineas was, during his time as a student, part of Slytherin House, whose emblem is a snake; as well as with the rest of the Black family, which was traditionally associated with that House, being the one into which most of its members were sorted.

After Hebrew, Phinehas ultimately comes from the Egyptian male given name ''Pa-nehasi'' (''pꜣ-nḥsj''), which literally means "the Nubian"<ref>[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Journals/JAOS/56/2/The_Egyptian_Origin_of_Some_English_Personal_Names*.html Alan H. Gardiner (1936), "The Egyptian Origin of Some English Personal Names" in the Journal of the American Oriental Society (JAOS), Vol. 56, page 192]</ref><ref>{{Wtlink|Phinehas#Etymology|Phinehas}}</ref>. Nubians are an ethnic group from southern Egypt and northern Sudan known for having dark skin. Nigellus comes from Latin ''niger'' meaning "black" and the diminutive suffix ''-lus'', making the adjective ''nigellus'' meaning "somewhat black" or "blackish"<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dnigellus1 nigellus], in Charlton T. Lewis and Charles Short (1879), A Latin Dictionary, Oxford: Clarendon Press</ref><ref>{{Wtlink|nigellus#Etymology|nigellus}}</ref>. Thus all three of Phineas Nigellus Black's names relate to the colour black.

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{OOTP|FA}}, Phineas Nigellus Black is played by [[John Atterbury]]. In the film, Dumbledore is seen asking the portrait of Black to check its opposite number at the Order headquarters during efforts to locate [[Arthur Weasley]]. This is the only "active" appearance of Black in the film series, seeing as he does not appear in the film adaptations of {{HBP}} and {{DH}}. However, this makes it unclear how Snape located Harry and Hermione in the [[Forest of Dean]].
*Black's portrait, as featured in {{OOTP|FA}}, looks very similar to [[commons:File:Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione by Raphael.jpg|a 1515 portrait of Balthazar Castiglione]] by {{w|Raphael}}. It's unknown if it was based upon that portrait.
*It can be briefly seen that the name Phineas is misspelled Phineus on the tapestry in the {{OOTP|FA}}.
*It is quite possible that Black's portrait was moved from another location to its current one when the [[Order of the Phoenix|Order]] moved into [[12 Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]] so that he could keep an eye on Harry for [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]].
*Black's appearance in the films was quite different, with grey hair and a large beard, wearing, instead of his Slytherin-coloured robes, eccentric headdresses quite common to the wizarding world, such as a pointed red cap with a fur brim and a turban.
*In {{HL}}, he is voiced by [[Simon Pegg]].<ref name="Simon-Pegg">[https://twitter.com/HogwartsLegacy/status/1613175447763972096 Please welcome @simonpegg as Headmaster Phineas Nigellus Black] at Twitter</ref>
