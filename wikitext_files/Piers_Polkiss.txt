{{Quote|Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them.|Description|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
'''Piers Polkiss''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] and [[Dudley Dursley]]'s best friend.<ref name="PS2"/> Despite being scrawny with a face like a [[rat]], he was a member of [[Dudley Dursley]]'s [[Dudley Dursley's gang|gang]] and was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs so Dudley could hit them.<ref name="PS3">{{PS|B|3}}</ref>

==Biography==
Piers did not like Dudley's cousin [[Harry Potter]], simply because Dudley didn't, and Piers always followed Dudley's lead.<ref name="PS2"/> Piers joined Dudley at [[Smeltings Academy]].<ref name="PS3">{{PS|B|3}}</ref>

===1991===

{{Quote|Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?|Piers' shock after witnessing Harry Potter talk to a [[snake]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
On [[23 June]] [[1991]], Dudley's eleventh birthday, Piers accompanied him, the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] and Harry to the [[zoo]]. During the trip, Piers saw Harry [[Parseltongue|talking]] to a [[Boa constrictor at the zoo|snake]] in the reptile house.

When Harry was pushed out of the way, and then [[Underage magic|unintentionally]] made the [[Vanishment|glass disappear]], Piers and Dudley jumped back in surprise. When Piers told the Dursleys that Harry had been talking to the snake, they gave Harry his longest ever punishment.<ref name="PS2">{{PS|B|2}}</ref>

===1995===
{{Quote|Nice right hook, Big D.|Piers congratulating Dudley|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
During the summer of [[1995]], Dudley lied to his parents saying that he was at the Polkisses' having tea, although Piers was with Dudley's gang as they roamed the [[Little Whinging|neighbourhood]], often smoking, committing petty vandalism, getting into fights, or bullying younger kids.<ref name="OOTP1">{{OOTP|B|1}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Piers is of Anglo-Saxon heritage and means "rock". It is a variant of Peter, from the Greek for "rock". Polkiss may be a variation of Polk, which itself is a variation of the Scottish names Pogue, Pollack, or Pollock, meaning "from the pool or pit".

==Behind the scenes==
*Piers will be portrayed by [[Mickey McAnulty]] in the upcoming {{HPTV}}.<ref>[https://x.com/HPMoviesNews/status/1946119594218848446  BREAKING: Mickey McAnulty has been cast as Piers Polkiss in the upcoming Harry Potter series on HBO Max.]</ref>
*Due to being Dudley's closest friend of the group, Piers Polkiss was most likely the gang's second-in-command.
* Piers was portrayed by [[Jason Boyd]] in {{OOTP|FA}}.
*Piers did not appear, nor was he even mentioned, in {{PS|FA}}.
*Piers has not appeared in {{LEGO|Y1}} and {{LEGO|Y2}}.
*It is mentioned several times in the books that all the members of Dudley's gang were big and stupid, but Piers was always described as being scrawny with a face like a rat. It is possible that Piers was scrawny when compared to the other members or that he gained a significant amount of weight after he went to the zoo with Dudley and Harry.
**That said, the ''[[Harry Potter Trading Card Game]]'' does [[Harry Hunting (Trading Card)|depict]] Piers as scrawny with a rat-like face alongside the bulky Dudley while [[Harry Hunting]], so maybe this was either a mistake from the artists who designed him and he was always intended to not be big like Dudley and his friends or that [[J. K. Rowling]] forgot to clarify that Piers was physically different than the rest of Dudley's gang.
