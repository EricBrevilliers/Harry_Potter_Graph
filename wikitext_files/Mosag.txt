{{Quote|...and you see how our family has grown, all through Hagrid's goodness...|Aragog|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
Sometime before [[1993]], Mosag was born and found by [[Rubeus Hagrid]]. Hagrid already owned one acromantula, [[Aragog]], who needed a wife to start a colony. He brought Mosag to the [[Forbidden Forest]] near [[Hogwarts Castle|Hogwarts school grounds]] and the two reproduced and began a family of Acromantulas. These acromantulas quickly grew to form a large colony that would attack any fresh meat. It was likely that she, like Aragog, was fond of Hagrid, and ordered her sons and daughters not to attack him.<ref name="COS15">{{COS|B|15}}</ref>

On [[20 April]] [[1997]], Aragog died of a long-suffering illness, leaving Mosag a widow.<ref name="HBP22">{{HBP|B|22}}</ref> Later on [[2 May]] [[1998]], when [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] attacked Hogwarts Castle during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Aragog and Mosag's many sons and daughters were forced out of their habitat by [[Death Eaters]], which made them enter the battle, attacking both sides.<ref name="DH31">{{DH|B|31}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Mosag is a Scottish Gaelic word which means "dirty female" or "filthy" according to [[J. K. Rowling]].<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2002/1002-sixtymin-stahl-reedit.html 60 Minutes interview from 3 October, 2002]</ref> ''A Dictionary of the Gaelic Language'' (Norman Macleod and Daniel Dewar, 1839) defines ''mosag'' as "a tawdry, drabbish woman; a worthless woman; a mean or avaricious woman."

==Behind the scenes==
*Mosag was only mentioned passively in {{COS}}, and is not mentioned in the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|film version]].
*It is unknown whether Mosag participated in the Battle of Hogwarts. Since she never actually appears and is only briefly mentioned, it is possible she died before Aragog. This seems plausible, as she likely shared her husband's respect for Hagrid, given that he helped her find a mate to start a colony. If she were still alive, she may have prevented her offspring from attacking Hagrid.
