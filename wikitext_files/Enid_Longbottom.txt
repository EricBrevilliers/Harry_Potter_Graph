'''Enid Longbottom''' (fl. [[1988]]) was the wife of [[Algie Longbottom]], and thus the aunt by marriage of [[Frank Longbottom]], and the great-aunt of [[Neville Longbottom]].<ref name="longbottomfamilytree" />

==Biography==
One time when Neville was eight, his great-uncle [[Algie Longbottom|Algie]] came over for tea, and ended up hanging the boy out of an upstairs window in yet another one of his many attempts to "force some [[magic]]" out of him. When Enid offered Algie a [[meringue]], he accidentally dropped Neville, but the boy bounced safely down the garden and out into the road. The family was overjoyed to learn that Neville was a [[wizardkind|wizard]].<ref name="PS7">{{PS|B|7}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Enid" was derived from Welsh ''enaid'' meaning "soul" or "life". She was the wife of Geraint in Arthurian legend.

==Behind the scenes==
She shares a name with [[Enid Pettigrew]], a character cut from the plot of [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]], and a possible relation to [[Peter Pettigrew]].
