'''Roxanne Weasley''' (b. [[2000s]]) was the daughter of [[George Weasley]] and [[Angelina Johnson|Angelina Weasley]] (née Johnson). She had an older brother, [[Fred Weasley (II)|Fred]], who was named after her [[Fred Weasley|late uncle]].<ref name=WFT> [https://archive.ph/qJjm4#selection-1403.0-1403.57 Times Online - The Unwritten Story of Harry's Friends and Their Children] (Archived)</ref> She may have shared her parents' love of [[Quidditch]], playing as either a [[Beater]] or a [[Chaser]].<ref>{{PM}} - [https://web.archive.org/web/20180314232750/https://www.pottermore.com/features/the-weasley-family-tree The Weasley Family Tree]: ''"As her parents shared a love of Quidditch, it’s possible that they passed this on to their daughter. The question is, would Roxanne have played as a Beater or a Chaser?''" (Archived)</ref>

==Etymology==
{{W|Roxanne}} is an English spelling of the French name ''Roxane'', which in turn comes from the Greek name ''Roxana'', derived from the Persian ''Roshanak'', meaning "bright" or "dawn". Roxana was the name of {{W|Alexander the Great}}'s first wife.<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/roxana Behind the Name: Roxana]</ref> Also, Roxanne is the name of a main character in Edmond Rostand's play ''{{W|Cyrano de Bergerac}}'', who is the love interest of the eponymous hero.
