'''Roberts''' was a [[Dark wizard]] who joined the [[Poacher Pack]].<ref name="HL" />

==Biography==
In [[1890]], Roberts complained about his sinuses so often that a fellow [[Wizard poacher|poacher]] grew "sick of" it. The poacher even told others in the pack to keep one [[Puffskein]] poached for Roberts, claiming its tongue could clear the boogies — though this may have been a sarcastic joke.<ref name="HL"/>
