{{Quote|Medieval, dates unknown. Most famous wizard of all time. Sometimes known as the Prince of Enchanters. Part of the Court of King Arthur.|Merlin's [[Chocolate Frog Card]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}
'''Merlin''' was a legendary [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and member of [[Arthur (king)|King Arthur]]'s [[Court of King Arthur|court]].<ref name="chocolate"/>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Merlin was born sometime during the [[Middle Ages|medieval era]].<ref name="chocolate">[[Chocolate Frog Card|Famous Wizard Card]] {{C|Merlin}}</ref> During his formative years, he attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], and was [[Sorting Ceremony|sorted]] into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]].<ref name="pottermore"/> He is mentioned, along with [[Cadogan]], as being part of one of Hogwarts's early generations,<ref name="HMHO">{{HM|3|HO}}</ref> thus it is likely that he was taught by [[Salazar Slytherin]] himself. During his time as a student, his proved himself a gifted [[Seer]], and [[Vision|foresaw]] the stately, long-bearded old wizard he would one day become; and created a magical projection of his older self that would manifest if people successfully solved the various puzzles he created later known as the [[Trials of Merlin]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AZmuZNu5LA Hogwarts Legacy - State of Play]</ref> Popular myth had it that Merlin's [[Merlin's wand|wand]] was made from of [[English oak]] (though as his grave had never been found, this could not be proven).<ref name="pm-wands">{{HPcom|wand-woods}}</ref>

{{Quote|This is what happens when you abandon the ways of ancient magic.|Merlin's portrait regarding the [[portrait curse]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
At some point in his life, Merlin studied the five secret rooms at Hogwarts that would one day come to be known as the fabled [[Cursed Vaults]] and obtained an understanding of not only the purpose for their existence, but also the [[ancient magic]] surrounding them. Later on in his life, a [[portrait]] was painted by him, which he educated to speak and act like himself, and taught about the vaults so that once hung at Hogwarts, it could advise future residents about them, although its warnings were too cryptic to be of much help to find the vaults and breaking the [[curse]]s.<ref name="HM52">{{HM|5|2}}</ref>

===Later life===
At some point in his lifetime, Merlin became a part of the [[Court of King Arthur|court]] of [[Arthur (king)|King Arthur]], assisting him during his reign.<ref name="chocolate"/> It is also widely believed by the wizarding community that he was friends with [[Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]], which helped him secure a position in the [[Knights of the Round Table]].<ref name="PM"/> Merlin was also an expert user of [[charm]]s, to the point of earning the epithet "Prince of Enchanters",<ref name="chocolate"/> and was an enemy of Arthur's half-sister, [[Morgan le Fay]], a [[Dark wizard|Dark witch]].<ref name="morganlefay">[[Chocolate Frog Card|Famous Wizard Card]] {{C|[[Morgan le Fay]]}}</ref> 

Merlin further believed that wizardkind should help [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] and live peacefully with them. To this end, he founded the [[Order of Merlin (organisation)|Order of Merlin]], an organisation which promoted Muggle rights, creating rules against using [[magic]] on them.<ref name="chocolate"/>

===Legacy===
[[File:Stained Glass 2.jpg|left|thumb]]
In commemoration of arguably the most famous wizard of all time, a stain glass window featuring Merlin's name was eventually fitted into the wall of the school's [[History of Magic Classroom]],<ref name="HL">{{HL}}</ref> and the [[Wizengamot]], the judicial body of the [[Wizards' Council]], began awarding a handsome golden medal to witches and wizards that distinguished themselves through their service to the wizarding community, known as the [[Order of Merlin]], named after the organisation which Merlin had founded.<ref name="PM-order-of-merlin">{{HPcom|order-of-merlin}}</ref> His name even became part of everyday [[wizarding idioms|wizarding vernacular]], such as the popular exclamations, "''[[Merlin's beard]]!''", and the more unusual "''Merlin's pants!''"

[[Slytherin]] students at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] took special pride in Merlin — "the most famous wizard in history" — having been [[Sorting Ceremony|Sorted]] into their [[Hogwarts Houses|House]].<ref name="chocolate"/> However, this fact is one that the other houses do not like to recognise. Some of the more prejudiced Slytherins in later history also tended to ignore the fact that the esteemed Merlin was in fact a champion of Muggle rights and disdained [[pure-blood]] [[Pure-blood supremacy|supremacism]].<ref name="pottermore"/>

Merlin had at least two portraits at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. One was located on one of the walls by the [[Grand Staircase]], next to the portrait of the old friend of his real-life counterpart and fellow courtier of King Arthur, Sir [[Cadogan]]. The other one was found in the [[Sphinx Clubhouse]]. In [[1988]], Merlin's portrait offered the residents of [[Hogwarts Castle]] advice on the [[Cursed Vaults]] while they were trying to free [[Beatrice Haywood]] from a painting, explaining that in order to understand the nature of [[curse]]s placed upon each of them, they first needed to know what the vaults had been built to hold; warning that this curse was their punishment for abandoning ancient magic and to the vaults, the people in Hogwarts were the curse.<ref name="HM52"/>

Merlin was immortalised on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]]. [[Harry Potter]] found a copy of this card in one of the [[Chocolate Frog]]s he bought on the [[Hogwarts Express]] on [[1 September]] [[1991]].<ref name="PS6">{{PS|B|6}}</ref> In the early [[1990s]], the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' published a letter by a reader suggesting a "[[Merlin Remembrance Day]]" be established.<ref name="DP1">{{DP|N|1}}</ref>

====Merlin's portrait and the Cursed Vaults====
[[File:Merlin Portrait 2.png|200px|thumb|A portrait of Merlin at Hogwarts]]
During the [[1988–1989 school year]] at Hogwarts, Merlin's portrait discussed the [[Cursed Vaults]] with his neighbouring portrait, Sir [[Cadogan]], and the [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]] ghost, Sir [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]], whom he confided that the [[portrait curse]] were nothing more than a "trap guarding the mouth of [[Buried Vault Hungarian Horntail|an all-consuming beast]]", and that a [[R's messengers|faceless]] [[Ben Copper|interloper]] had been tampering with the portraits.<ref name="HM53">{{HM|5|3}}</ref> He also expressed the opinion that if a member of [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]] had been running the school, their current predicament would never have happened.<ref name="HM55">{{HM|5|5}}</ref>

Later still, when questioned about whether he knew anything about a painting that was linked to any of the Cursed Vaults, Merlin's portrait recalled "[[Vault portrait|a portrait]] of an [[Buried Vault|underground chamber]] choked with shadow", and explained that in the case of the vaults, "one curse begets the next".<ref name"HM512">{{HM|5|12}}</ref> At a later point, when [[Jacob's sibling]] had to wreak havoc at the school as per the instruction of [[Peeves]] the poltergeist in exchange for the [[vault portrait]] by pretending that they were convinced that it was Merlin, and not Cadogan who defeated the [[Wyvern of Wye]], Merlin's portrait did not correct them. Instead, when Sir Cadogan called upon his painted companion to defend his honour and to help him correct the student, Merlin's portrait amusingly pretended to be unable to defend anything other than ancient magic, and told Sir Cadogan to fight his own battles.<ref name="HM522">{{HM|5|22}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Magic]]al mastery''':  As perhaps one of the most famous (and famously accomplished) [[Wizardkind|wizards]] in the history of the wizarding world, it can be assumed that Merlin was one of the greatest wizards of his time.<ref name="chocolate" /> He was sufficiently well-versed in the [[Hogwarts subjects|magical arts]] to have understood and mastered the ability to wield ancient magic.<ref name="HM52" />
*'''[[Ancient magic]]''': While it is unknown whether Merlin possessed the rare ability to perceive traces of ancient magic like [[Percival Rackham]] and [[Isidora Morganach]],<ref name="HL"/> his portrait's rebuke towards the denizens of Hogwarts Castle in the [[20th century]] for having "''abandoned the ways of ancient magic''"<ref name="HM52"/> and insights into the fabled [[Cursed Vaults]] testified to the fact that he had, like the [[Hogwarts founders]] and the [[Keepers]],<ref name="HL" /> been a sufficiently accomplished wizard to wield said power himself.<ref name="HM522" />
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Merlin's exceptional ability in this field of magic was known, to the point he has been dubbed the "Prince of Enchanters".<ref name="chocolate"/> He was regarded as a Charms specialist.<ref name="WOTC"/> 
*[[Defence Against the Dark Arts|'''Defence Against the Dark Arts''']]: As the sworn enemy of the infamous [[Dark wizard|Dark witch]] [[Morgan le Fay]], he presumably excelled at warding off the [[Dark Arts]].<ref name="chocolate" />
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Merlin was also a famously accomplished duellist, as he at one point fought in a duel of historic proportions with Morgan le Fay, an event that was depicted in a stain glass window outside [[Classroom 3C]] at Hogwarts during the [[1890–1891 school year]].<ref name="HL" />
*'''[[Spell creation]]''' {{c|possibly}}: Merlin possibly had skill in making spells, since some posit the [[Disarming Charm]] was a creation of Merlin's; although some (as [[Miranda Goshawk]] wrote in the ''[[Book of Spells]]'') maintain that that [[spell]] was created in the [[14th century]] by [[Elizabeth Smudgling]].<ref name="WBS">{{WBS}}</ref>
*'''[[Study of Ancient Runes]]''' (possibly): Merlin may have been skilled at writing and reading in [[rune|runic]], as [[Merlin's book|a book]] that was hand-written in unfamiliar [[rune]]s and believed to have belonged to him was said to have been kept at the [[Headmaster's Office|Head's Office]] in [[Hogwarts Castle]].<ref name="PM">{{PM}} - [[Hogwarts sorting quiz]]</ref>
*'''[[Divination]]''': Merlin was a [[Seer]] and adept at divination, as he [[Prophecy|foresaw]] his own rise to prominence in old age already as a student at Hogwarts<ref>{{HL}}</ref> and was later depicted seeing a green [[dragon]] while [[crystal-gazing]].<ref name="WOTC" /> In addition, according to [[Nora Treadwell]], Merlin often referred to [[mallowsweet]] (a herb used in divination) in his writings, and even used them as part of the solution to his trials.<ref name="HL" /> 

== Possessions ==
[[File:MerlinBook.png|200px|thumb|Merlin's book]]
*'''[[Merlin's wand|Wand]]''': Merlin owned a [[wand]] that was of an unknown length and [[Wand core|core]], which was believed to be made of [[English oak]] [[Wand wood|wood]] (although his grave has never been found, so this is unproven). It is unknown whether he made the wand or purchased it.<ref name="pottermore"/>
*'''[[Merlin's book|Book]]''': Merlin was believed to own this mysterious book, the contents of which were unknown and either potentially mundane, mysterious or even dangerous. It was written in an unknown [[Rune|runic alphabet]].<ref name="PM"/>
*'''[[Crystal ball]]''': Merlin owned a crystal ball, which he could view a green [[dragon]] within.<ref name="WOTC">{{See image|File:Merlin-CFC-WOTC.jpg}}</ref>
*'''[[Merlin's idiomatic possessions]]''': Many [[Wizarding idioms]] referred to Merlin or particular objects he owned, though it is unlikely he owned some items such as a [[Merlin's watch|pocket-watch]], as he predates their invention.

==Behind the scenes==
*Merlin is a wizard featured in many British legends. Though he first appeared under the name Myrddin Wyllt (Merlin the wild) in Welsh literature as a half-crazed prophet of the forest, he is perhaps most famous as a central figure in the Arthurian legend. He is most commonly depicted as the adviser of King Arthur.<ref>{{Wikilink|Merlin}}</ref>
*Although seemingly having been {{W|Purposeful omission|purposefully omitted}} due to their lack of relevance to the overall story, it is very likely that at least some elements of the real-life myths would have been carried over by Rowling to her version of Merlin, even though wizarding and Muggle versions on the subject still differed from one another to some extent.<ref>{{HPcom|sir-cadogan}}</ref> This is further underpinned by the fact that Merlin, who according to the Arthurian Legends was described as a druid that was closely in touch with nature and possessed abilities that almost all of which were achievable in Rowling's wizarding world. These includes a [[Seer|prophetic insight]] into future events, the ability to [[Animagus|shape-shift]], [[Metamorphmagus|change]] or [[Human Transfiguration|modify]] his own appearance,<ref>Which is made possible for wizards through either [[Human Transfiguration]] or by [[Metamorphmagus|Metamorphmagi]].</ref> [[Apparition|appear and disappear]] without notice, [[Atmospheric Charm|control climate]], alter other people's [[Confundus Charm|perception of reality]], and [[Legilimency|read people's hearts and true desires]]. This also includes his power to seemingly age backwards, which could be explained in-universe if [[De-ageing amulet|de-ageing amulets]] existed in medieval times. 
*Some myths claim Merlin to be a [[Druid]] and/or raised among them. While yet to be confirmed, this may very well be the case of his in-universe counterpart, as the Druids' respect and veneration of nature and all of its beings fits very well with the fact that Merlin not only reportedly was chosen by a wand made of English oak, a wood known to have "an affinity with the magic of the natural world" It would also explain his desire to promote Muggle rights, as the British Druids were historically speakingrelatively tolerant of beliefs of others provided and hence would have discouraged him from adopting a belief in the inherent superiority of pure-bloods found in Slytherin House, which would have been especially notable if he indeed was taught by Salazar Slytherin himself.
*One of the possible questions in the [[Sorting Ceremony|Sorting]] quiz at {{PM}} mentions that Merlin marked his possessions with [[Mark of Merlin|a mysterious rune]]. Since this is just a possible answer to a hypothetical question, it is unclear if Merlin actually used this symbol as his mark in historical canon.
*A {{PM}} "Features" article about what the portraits at Hogwarts do when no one is looking, asks us to "''imagine an ancient portrait of Merlin stopping a student for a chat because the boy she likes will be coming down the corridor any minute now''"<ref>{{PM}} - [https://www.pottermore.com/features/things-we-bet-the-hogwarts-portraits-do-when-noone-is-watching Features: "Things we bet the Hogwarts portraits do when no one is watching"]</ref> While this is just a hypothetical scenario, there is at least one portrait of Merlin at Hogwarts as shown in {{HM}}.
*[[Albus Dumbledore]], an extraordinarily talented and powerful wizard, resembled Merlin in many ways, such as the iconic long beard and prodigious magical skill. Both were also "''Muggle sympathisers''".
*It is unusual that Merlin, one of the most famous proponents of [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] rights and tolerance, would be placed in [[Slytherin]], a house strongly associated with anti-Muggle views, although since he was such an ambitious person with all his plans for the Order of Merlin, it is not entirely surprising. Slytherins are not necessarily evil or malicious individuals by default nor is there any reliable information on whether or not the House of Slytherin actually held the same views in Merlin's time. In addition, one of the lesser-known attributes Slytherin prizes is fraternity and cultivating beneficial alliances, which would correspond to Merlin's desire for unity between magical and non-magical peoples.
*In fact, the entire placement of Merlin at Hogwarts is paradoxical. Hogwarts was founded in the 9th/10th century, and while the early 9th century was the time the first records of the Arthur-myth were written, the actual myth plays around the year 500 A.D., meaning that the 'historical' Merlin in fact predates Hogwarts by roughly five-hundred years.
*Coincidentally, {{W|Colin Morgan}}, who plays Merlin in BBC One's ''{{W|Merlin (TV series)|Merlin}}'', was sorted into Slytherin in {{PM}}.{{fact}}
*Merlin may have been an inspiration to the [[Sphinx Club]], as a portrait of him appears in the [[Sphinx Club|clubhouse]] once a sufficient rank is achieved.
