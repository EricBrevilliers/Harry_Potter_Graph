'''Perenelle Flamel''' (pre-[[1334]]–between [[1992]] and [[1996]])<ref name="death"/> was a [[France|French]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], the wife of famous Philosopher and [[Alchemy|Alchemist]], [[Nicolas Flamel]], who was known for his creation of the [[Philosopher's Stone]]. She became known as one of the [[List of oldest wizards|oldest witches]] in history through her use of the [[Elixir of Life]], a life extending [[potion]] derived from her husband's creation. 

==Biography==
She and her husband met at [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]] in their youth.<ref name="PM">{{HPcom|beauxbatons-academy-of-magic}}</ref> Perenelle and her husband drank the [[Elixir of Life]] produced by the stone, and were functionally [[Immortality|immortal]] until the stone was destroyed in [[1992]].

Perenelle and her husband partly funded the construction of the [[Palace of Beauxbatons]] and its grounds with alchemist [[gold]]. As a result, a [[Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel Fountain|fountain]] stands in the middle of the castle [[Beauxbatons park|park]] named after them, believed to have [[Healing magic|healing]] and beautifying properties.<ref name="PM"/>

In consultation with [[Albus Dumbledore]], the couple decided to destroy the stone to prevent its use by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], who had nearly succeeded in stealing the stone for his own purposes within the last year. As they were no longer able to produce the potion, she and Nicolas later died after their current supply ran out. She was at least six hundred and eighty three years old at the time of her death.<ref name="birthdate" />

Having lived for so long, both Perenelle and her husband were willing to finally embrace death. [[Albus Dumbledore]] compared the experience for them to being like "going to bed after a very long day".<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref>

==Relationships==
===Nicolas Flamel===
Perenelle Flamel was the wife of [[Nicolas Flamel]]. She, along with her husband, drank the [[Elixir of Life]] created by the [[Philosopher's Stone]], making them functionally [[Immortality|immortal]]. Nicolas and Perenelle lived happily together for over 600 years.<ref name="PS13">{{PS|B|13}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Perenelle'' is the Old French form on the name ''Petronilla'', a diminutive of the name ''Petronia'', which is the feminine form of ''Petronius'' - a Roman family name which is possibly derived from Latin petro, petronis "yokel".

Petro-, of both Latin and Greek origin, is a prefix meaning "of or pertaining to stone".

The name ''Flamel'' means in Old French "flame". Such meaning can be associated to Flamel's work as an alchemist.

==Behind the scenes==
*Like {{W|Nicolas Flamel|her husband}}, Perenelle Flamel is a genuine historical figure. They were married in 1368 and, at that time, she had already been married twice and brought that inheritance to their union. This fortune, added to the proceeds from Nicolas's businesses made the couple quite wealthy and they were known as generous benefactors. According to historical record, Perenelle Flamel died in 1397. According to a book written in 1612, she was an alchemist in her own right though there is no known historical record of this.
*Unlike her husband, Perenelle did not appear in {{COG}}, aside from a possible mention.
*In the {{HPTV}}, Perenelle is portrayed by [[Marthe Keller]].<ref name="gazette">[https://sffgazette.com/fantasy/harry-potter/harry-potter-set-photos-reveal-first-look-at-parts-of-hogwarts-including-hagrids-hut-as-two-more-join-cast-a9260 HARRY POTTER Set Photos Reveal First Look At Parts Of Hogwarts, Including Hagrid's Hut, As Two More Join Cast]</ref>
*The inclusion of Perenelle in the TV series is a completely new scene added to the franchise. She appears along with her husband ([[Lambert Wilson]]) and Dumbledore ([[John Lithgow]]) by a coast, marking Perenelle's first appearance in the entire franchise
