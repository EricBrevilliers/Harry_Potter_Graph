'''Professor Vindictus Viridian''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was a [[potioneer]], author and [[Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the early [[18th century|eighteenth century]].

==Biography==
Based on his portrait, Viridian was a [[potioneer]]. At some point in his life, he became [[Headteacher|Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="WWHP">{{WWHP}} {{See image|File:Dumbledore's office portraits.jpg}}</ref> Also during his lifetime, he published a famous book on [[dark charm]]s: ''[[Curses and Counter-Curses]]''.<ref name="PS5"/> He also published the book ''[[How to Tame Tigers]]''.<ref name="csf">{{COS|F}} {{See image|File:HowtoTameTigers.jpg}}</ref>

===Post-mortem===
Professor Viridian died sometime in or prior to [[1994]].<ref name="DOD"/> Two [[Headmaster portraits|portraits]] of him hung at Hogwarts: one was painted in [[1703]]<ref>{{See image|File:VindictusViridian3.jpg}}</ref> and hung in the Headmaster's office along with the portraits of other Headmasters and Headmistresses,<ref name="WWHP"/> and the other hung in the [[Grand Staircase]].<ref name="OPg">{{OOTP|G}}</ref>

In the [[1995–1996 school year]], Viridian's portrait at the [[Grand Staircase]] was used to conceal the entrance to the [[Room of Rewards]]. He was frequently annoyed by all the hustle and bustle of the students' school life. In order to gain entry to the Room of Rewards, [[Hermione Granger]] threatened to convince [[Myrtle Warren]] to haunt the landing where the portrait hung. Disliking Myrtle, Viridian let [[Harry Potter]] and his friends through.<ref name="OPg"/>

After the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], he was most likely among those who congratulated [[Harry Potter]] on his defeat of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], along with the other [[Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|headteachers]] of Hogwarts.<ref name="DH36">{{DH|B|36}} – "All around the walls, the headmasters and head mistresses of Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation"</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Professor Viridian was highly proficient with [[curse]]s, [[hex]]es and [[jinx]]es, and wrote [[Curses and Counter-Curses|a book]] which included [[Dark charm]]s such as the: [[Full Body-Bind Curse]], [[Jelly-Legs Curse]], [[Leg-Locker Curse]], [[Pimple Jinx]], [[Stickfast Hex]], [[Tickling Hex]], [[Tongue-Tying Curse]] and [[Hair Loss Curse]].<ref name="PS5">{{PS|B|5}}</ref>
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Professor Viridian appeared to be an accomplished [[potioneer]], as evidenced by several portraits of him brewing various [[potion]]s.

==Etymology==
The name Vindictus is derived from the Latin ''vindicta'' ("revenge") and the surname Viridian from the Latin ''viridis'' ("green").

==Behind the scenes==
*{{HPLE}} confirms that his surname was misspelled "Veridian" in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film series]].
