==Etymology==
{{W|Euan|Euan}} is an English male given name, anglicised from the [[Gaelic|Scottish Gaelic]] name "Eòghann". The Scottish name has two debated origins: it is either a borrowing of Latin ''Eugenius'' ("{{W|Eugene (given name)|Eugene}}"), itself borrowed from Ancient Greek Εὐγένιος (''Eugénĭos''; "well-brown", "noble") or a reflex of Middle irish ''Eógan'', from Proto-Celtic ''*Iwogenos'', composed of the elements ''*iwos'' ("[[yew]]") and ''*genos'' ("born"). In Ireland the name was often ascribed the meaning of "little swift one", though the origin of this is uncertain. It can also be an alternative version of "{{W|Evan|Evan}}", which is an anglicised form of the Welsh ''Ifan'' ("{{W|John (given name)|John}}"), from Late Latin ''Jōhannēs'', reflex of ''Iōannēs'', borrowed from Ancient Greek Ἰωάννης (''Iōánnēs''), borrowed from Hebrew יוחנן (''Yokhanan'') meaning "[[God]] is gracious", composed of יהו־ (''Y'ho''; theophoric name prefix) and חנן (''khanán''; "to be gracious").

{{W|Abercrombie (surname)|Abercrombie}} is a Scottish habitational surname derived from the name of a parish in Fife, [[Scotland]], meaning "mouth of River Crombie" ([[Gaelic]]: ''Obar Chrombaidh''), located on the northern shore of the Firth of Forth. It is an anglicised form of Brettonic Abarcrumbach; a compound of ''aber'' ("river mouth") and River Ⅽrombie's Brittonic name ''Crumbach'', either cognate with or adapted from its Gaelic name ''Crombie'', derived from ''crom'' ("bent", "crooked").
