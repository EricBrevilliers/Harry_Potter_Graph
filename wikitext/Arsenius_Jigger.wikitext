'''Professor'''<ref name="HPLE"/> '''Arsenius Jigger''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and an author specialising in [[Potions (class)|Potions]] and [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]].

==Biography==
In his lifetime, he wrote several books in the fields of [[Potion]]s and [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], having written: ''[[Magical Drafts and Potions]]'',<ref name="PS5">{{PS|B|5}}</ref> ''[[Potion Opuscule]]'',<ref name="hppts">{{HPPS}}, p. 504 {{see image|File:PotionOpuscule.jpg}}</ref> and ''[[The Essential Defence Against the Dark Arts]].''<ref name="POAF">{{POA|F}}</ref>

Arsenius Jigger also contributed to ''[[Transfiguration Today]]'' in the [[1920s]] such as the article ''[[Lycanthropy]] v. [[Werewolf]]ry''.<ref name="FBF">{{FB|F}} {{see image|File:TransfigurationToday.png}}</ref> He was also, at an unknown point, a professor of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="HPLE"/> A shop in [[Diagon Alley]], [[London]]  bears the name [[Slug & Jiggers Apothecary|Slug and Jiggers]], and may have been founded or owned by him.

During the [[Calamity]] in the late [[2010s]] or early [[2020s]], a [[Calamity Investigator]] working for the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] discovered a forgotten chapter of Jigger's ''Magical Drafts and Potions'' detailing his version of the [[Invigoration Draught]]. The Calamity Investigator studied his technique, finding it unusual and difficult to master. However, they were eventually able to use it to improve the effectiveness of their own Invigoration Draught.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>

The same Calamity Investigator later read an [[Arsenius Jigger's potion ingredient editorial|editorial]] written by Jigger regarding potion ingredient preparation, suggesting that shaving fine slivers of [[newt spleen]] instead of chopping them helped to blend them more easily. Although the investigator believed they would never be able to fully remove the scent of spleen from their hands, using Jigger's methods did reduce the brewing time for their [[Wit-Sharpening Potion]]. The same Calamity Investigator also re-read their personal copy of Jigger's ''Magical Drafts and Potions'' and discovered that they had overlooked one of his passages on [[potion skimming]], a technique which removed the frothy film from the surface of a potion, allowing for more consistent heating throughout the potion. The investigator utilised this technique to reduce the brewing time for all potions that they brewed.<ref name="WU"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Jigger was an expert in defensive [[magic]], having written the well-regarded DADA textbook ''[[The Essential Defence Against the Dark Arts]]'', and was even the [[Professor]] of this subject at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] at an unknown point, showing his highly proficient knowledge in defending oneself against the [[Dark Arts]].<ref name="HPLE"/>
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Jigger was highly accomplished in the [[magic]]al art and [[science]] of potion-making, having written two Potions books in his lifetime, ''[[Magical Drafts and Potions]]''<ref name="PS5"/> and ''[[Potion Opuscule]]'',<ref name="hppts"/> the former of which was used as Hogwarts textbook in the [[Potions (class)|subject]].<ref name="PS5"/>
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Jigger was also knowledgeable of this notably very advanced, difficult and scientific branch of [[magic]], having contributed to the Transfiguration academic journal ''[[Transfiguration Today]]'', with an article regarding [[Werewolf|Werewolves]] and [[Lycanthropy]], showing he was well informed of the nature of [[Human Transfiguration]], a particularly hard form of transfiguration.<ref name="FBF"/>

==Etymology==
*Arsenius may be derived from the word "arsenious" meaning "containing arsenic", a very poisonous metallic element. Arsenius may also be be a reference to the famous physicist and chemist {{W|Svante Arrhenius}}, most widely known for formulating the first modern definition of acids and bases in molecular terms.
*A jigger can refer to a liquid measurement that is used often for liquor, or a measuring cup specifically for measuring that amount of liquid. In the [[United States of America]], a jigger usually holds 1.5 fluid ounces (44 ml).<ref>{{Wikilink|Jigger (bartending)}}</ref> In modern bartending, a jigger is 50 ml.
