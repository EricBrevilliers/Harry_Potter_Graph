==Biography==
{{Quote|Wish I could've studied here when Phyllida Spore was Headmistress. Greatest Herbologist of all time. I've read ''One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi'' at least a thousand times.|An [[Hufflepuff]] student at Hogwarts in [[1890]]|Hogwarts Legacy}}
[[File:Phyllida Spore.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Phyllida Spore]]
Phyllida Spore lived in the [[15th century]].<ref name="1408portrait" /> She studied [[Herbology]], writing ''[[One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi]]'', a textbook that was still used at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]].<ref name="ps5" /><ref name="hbp25">{{HBP|B|25}}</ref> 

Spore became the [[Headteacher|Headmistress]] of Hogwarts during her lifetime.<ref name="GFf21" /> At some point, she also earned the title "Dame",<ref name="dameportrait" /> the female equivalent of the honour of [[knight]]hood in [[Great Britain]].<ref name="damewiki">{{Wikilink|Dame (title)}}</ref> During her tenure Spore finished work on ''[[The Spore Scrolls]]'', a collection of [[Herbology]] scrolls which detailed how to cultivate the highly powerful [[Magical Enhancer]]. Initially archiving the scrolls in the [[Hogwarts Library]], she later realised how dangerous the fungus she created could be, so she hid the only known specimen, ''The Spore Scrolls'', and [[Phyllida Spore's letter|a letter]] in a [[The Spore Scrolls' box|box]] in the [[Forbidden Forest]], under the guard of the [[centaurs]]. Years later, [[Albus Dumbledore]] discovered the box and, sharing Professor Spore's concerns about the Magical Enhancer, left it hidden in the forest.<ref name="HMTSS"/><ref >{{HM}}, HOGWARTS DIARY: THE SPORE SCROLLS {{See video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg-dWpXVIoI}}</ref>

Professor Spore died sometime in or before [[1984]].<ref name="HMTSS"/> Two [[portrait]]s of her hung at Hogwarts: one painted in [[1408]] depicted a middle aged woman,<ref name="1408portrait" /> and another, hung in the [[Headmaster's office]],<ref name="GFf21" /> depicted her as a younger witch with long dark hair sitting in a chair with skull-shaped finials.<ref name="dameportrait" />

After the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], she was most likely among those who congratulated [[Harry Potter]] on his defeat of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], along with the other [[Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|headteachers]] of Hogwarts.<ref name="DH36">{{DH|B|36}} – "All around the walls, the headmasters and head mistresses of Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation"</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Herbology]]''': Phyllida was a very skilled and knowledgeable [[Herbologist]], having thorough knowledge of ''[[One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi]]'' and having written several books about the subject.<ref name="ps5"/> She was the first to cultivate a [[Magical Enhancer|special fungus]] that could enhance a wizards magical abilities beyond imagination. [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]] called it "the [[Philosopher's Stone]] of Herbology".
*'''[[Healing magic]]''': One of her books (''[[Healing at Home with Herbs]]'') specialised on the healing properties of such herbs, showing she also had good knowledge of healing [[magic]].
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Phyllida was able to cast a unique [[Anti-Alohomora Charm]] on [[The Spore Scrolls' box|''The Spore Scrolls''' box]], which could only be unlocked by the incumbent [[Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts Headteacher]].

==Behind the scenes==
*The portrait of Spore that is featured in the ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Goblet of Fire]]'' film was based on an [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Elizabeth_Barrett_Browning_by_Michele_Gordigiani_1858.jpg 1858 portrait of poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806–1861)], by Michele Gordigiani.

==Etymology==
Her first name is from Greek for "leaf" or "plant". A spore is a body produced by fungi, algae and non-flowering plants that is very protective and resistant to drought.
