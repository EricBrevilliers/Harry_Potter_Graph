==Biography==
[[File:Young Death Eaters.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Avery at a [[Slug Club]] supper with his school friends Tom Riddle, Lestrange, and others]]
Avery attended Hogwarts at the same time as [[Tom Riddle]], and was [[Sorting Ceremony|sorted]] into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]. He became a member of [[Tom Riddle's gang|Riddle's gang]], and was a favourite student of [[Horace Slughorn]]. Avery was present at the same Slug Club meeting in [[1943]] as [[Tom Riddle]] and was reprimanded by the Potions Master for failing to hand in a particular essay.<ref name="HBP17" /><ref name="HBP23" />

==Personality and traits==
With what little we see of Avery, as a teenager he admired Tom Riddle and already viewed him as a leader. Like the other members of the gang, he already was committing dark acts as a student, meaning he was likely sadistic even then. He appeared to be somewhat lax in his schoolwork as Slughorn quite sternly threatened to give him detention if his essay wasn't completed. Despite this his was likely a skilled wizard or related to someone notable since he was chosen to be in the Slug Club.

==Etymology==
''Avery'' is an English surname derived from an Old French version of the name Alfred. The meaning of the name is derived from the Old English words ''aelf'', meaning elf, and ''raed'', meaning counsel.

==Behind the scenes==
*Another Death Eater named [[Avery (Marauder-era)|Avery]] attended Hogwarts at the same time as [[Severus Snape]]. Given the timeline, it is possible that they are father and son.
*It's unknown if he was still alive and active during the [[Second Wizarding War]], since all references to an Avery seem to be to the younger one. Regardless there are several Death Eaters throughout the series who are never identified. If he survived until the end of the series he would've presumably been killed or arrested following the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].
