{{Quote|Kendra was a fine woman.|[[Elphias Doge]] regarding Kendra's character|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
'''Kendra Dumbledore''' (c. [[1851]]<ref name="birth" /> – summer [[1899]])<ref name="death" /> was a [[Muggle-born]] [[wizardkind|witch]]<ref name="blood"/> and the wife of [[Percival Dumbledore]]. She was also the mother of [[Albus Dumbledore|Albus]], [[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]], and [[Ariana Dumbledore]]. When her daughter Ariana was fourteen years old she lost control of her magic, causing an explosion that killed Kendra,<ref name="death2">{{DH|B|28}} - "“Then, when she was fourteen ... See, I wasn’t there,” said Aberforth. “If I’d been there, I could have calmed her down. She had one of her rages, and my mother wasn’t as young as she was, and ... it was an accident. Ariana couldn’t control it. But my mother was killed.”"</ref> as she had become an [[Obscurus]].<ref name="SOD">{{SOD}}</ref> After her death, Albus (her oldest son) was left to care for Aberforth and Ariana, as Percival was in Azkaban. 

==Biography==
{{Dialogue|Muriel|...a terrifying woman, simply terrifying. Muggle-born, though I heard she pretended otherwise —|Elphias Doge|She never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a fine woman.|[[Muriel]] gossiping about the Dumbledores|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
After her daughter, Ariana, was attacked by [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] boys who saw her perform magic, Kendra moved the family to [[Godric's Hollow]], while her husband was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for taking revenge upon the Muggles who hurt Ariana. He did not reveal his reasons to the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], and both he and Kendra kept the attack a secret, out of fear that Ariana would be considered a threat to the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]] and confined to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]], as the attack left the young witch mentally disturbed and [[Obscurial|unable to control her magic]].<ref name="DH28"/>

While her husband was imprisoned and her sons attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], Kendra took care of Ariana. Rumours, spread by people such as Muriel and her cousin [[Lancelot (Healer)|Lancelot]], suggested that Kendra was keeping her "[[Squib]]" daughter locked up in a cellar. When Ariana was fourteen years old, she lost control of her magic, and the explosion she caused killed Kendra.<ref name="death2" /> Albus and [[Elphias Doge]] attended the [[Funeral of Kendra Dumbledore|funeral]], along with Aberforth.<ref name="DH28"/>

After Kendra's death, the cause of which "''nobody ever seemed sure''" (according to Muriel),<ref name="DH8">{{DH|B|8}}</ref> Ariana was taken care of by her oldest brother [[Albus Dumbledore|Albus]]. She was eventually killed in a three-way [[Duelling|duel]] between Albus, [[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]], and [[Gellert Grindelwald]].<ref name="DH28"/>

==Physical appearance==
Kendra had jet black hair which she tended to wear in a high bun, dark eyes, high cheekbones, and a straight nose. [[Harry Potter]], upon seeing a photograph of her, thought she looked [[Native Americans|Native American]], possibly indicating her heritage. He also thought her face had a "carved quality", and noted her expression as being "formally composed".

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother's knee. Secrets and lies, that's how we grew up...|The manner in which Kendra raised her children|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
Little is known about Kendra Dumbledore, but much was said about her in gossip. [[Muriel]] deemed her a proud, terrifying woman who cared a great deal for her reputation and pretended not to be [[Muggle-born]], apparently aspiring to higher social status; Muriel also stated that she was ashamed by her "Squib" daughter [[Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]] and she kept her locked in a cellar. However, Muriel gossiped maliciously about many people, thus her opinion was not necessarily reliable. Elphias Doge, a good and close friend of her son Albus, described Kendra as a ''"fine woman",'' implying she was of good nature and had deep love for her family. 

Statements made by her son [[Aberforth Dumbledore]] suggest that Kendra made keeping the secret of her daughter's condition her highest priority and was strict with her children about following her example. She seems to have kept herself isolated from other people. Given her manner of death and Aberforth's claim that he was able to get Ariana to eat and to calm down when Kendra could not, she may have had a slightly less strong relationship with her daughter. Despite this, however, Kendra evidently loved her daughter and since she was able to keep Ariana calm while Aberforth was at school, she was most likely far closer to Ariana then Albus was.

==Relationships==
===Family===
{{Quote|...my father went after the bastards that did it, and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he'd done it, because if the Ministry had known what Ariana had become, she'd have been locked up in St Mungo's for good... We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about she was ill, and my mother looked after her, and tried to keep her calm and happy.|The Dumbledore family's latter life|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Ariana Dumbledore Hog's Head.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Ariana, her only daughter, who Kendra and her husband gave up everything to protect]]
Kendra was devastated by her daughter's attack. [[Percival Dumbledore]], her husband, retaliated against the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] boys who assaulted Ariana, and was sent to [[Azkaban]]. He never told the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] his reasons, knowing that if her condition were discovered, Ariana would be permanently confined to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]] as a threat to the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy|Statute of Secrecy]]. To maintain this secrecy, Kendra moved her family to [[Godric's Hollow]] and looked after Ariana, regularly making her favourite soup as a means to calm her emotional state. However, while Ariana's brother [[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]] was the only one able to keep her calm when she was in one of her trauma attacks, the fact that Kendra was able to live alone with Ariana while Aberforth was away at school implies that Kendra and Ariana bore a close mother-daughter relationship. Eventually, Ariana accidentally killed her mother in an explosion of uncontrollable [[magic]].<ref name="DH28">{{DH|B|28}}</ref>

[[File:The Secrets of Dumbledore - Albus Aberforth.jpeg|250px|thumb|right|Albus and Aberforth, her sons]]
Kendra's relationship with her two sons, [[Albus Dumbledore|Albus]] and [[Aberforth Dumbledore]], is largely unknown. She read ''[[The Warlock's Hairy Heart]]'' from {{TBB}} to Albus at least, implying she at least tried to have a good relationship with them. However, while he was devastated by his mother's death, Aberforth resented her secretive nature and bitterly stated that they only learnt lies and secrets from her and that they were better off, though he evidently still loved her a lot and seemed to have understood that Kendra's secretive nature stemmed from her desire to protect Ariana. It should be noted that it was also presumably Kendra that taught Aberforth how to cook Ariana's favourite soup. 

When Albus looked into the [[Mirror of Erised]], he saw his family alive and whole, showing that even if Kendra's relationship with Albus was not so good, Albus still loved her truly.

==Etymology==
*{{W|Kendra}} is a name of disputed origin. It may come from Anglo-Saxon meaning "understanding, knowledge". It may be a variation of the English name ''Kenda'', meaning "[[water]] baby", or ''Dakota'', meaning "magical power". Alternatively, it may come from the name ''Kendrick'', which is either derived from Welsh for "greatest champion" or Anglo-Saxon for "family ruler".

==Behind the scenes==
*{{HPFW}} and {{DH|GA1}} incorrectly states Kendra's death date as [[18 November]].
*In a ''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]]'' prop for {{DH|F1}}, Kendra's name is transcribed as "Canard".<ref>See [http://www.mugglenet.com/viewer/?image_location=/movie7/books/page_lifeandlies.jpg this image].</ref>
*The epitaph on Kendra and [[Ariana Dumbledore]]'s gravestone, which was made of [[granite]], as recorded in {{DH}} is Matthew 6:21 from the Christian Bible: "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." This epitaph, chosen by [[Albus Dumbledore]], is curiously similar to the function of one of Albus's inventions, the [[Deluminator]].
*If Kendra was in fact Native American, she may have studied magic at [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].
*[[Marie Jackson]] playing Kendra was supposed to make Kendra's first in-person appearance in {{COG}}, but her scenes were deleted.<ref name="mariejackson"/>
