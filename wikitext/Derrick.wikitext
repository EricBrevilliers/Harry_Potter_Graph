'''Peregrine Derrick'''<ref name="QWC">{{QWC}}</ref> (born c. [[1977]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in [[1988]].<ref name="year">In {{OOTP|B|19}}, [[Angelina Johnson]] states, "Last year's Beaters, Derrick and Bole, have left." This indicates Derrick's seventh year was [[1994–1995 school year|1994–1995]] and that he kept his position as Beater despite the cancellation of Quidditch matches during the Triwizard Tournament held that same term.</ref>

==Biography==
[[Sorting Ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Slytherin]], Derrick played as a [[Beater]] on the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]], along with [[Lucian Bole]], in the [[1993–1994 school year]].<ref name="POA15">{{POA|B|15}}</ref>

Although there were no [[Quidditch]] matches at Hogwarts during the [[1994–1995 school year]] because of the [[Triwizard Tournament]], he held his position on the Slytherin team, at least nominally, until his graduation at the end of term.<ref name="year"/> He and Bole were replaced by [[Vincent Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle]] at the start of the [[1995–1996 school year]]. [[Angelina Johnson]], the new captain of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], joked to her teammates that she was always shocked that Derrick and Bole were able to make it on to the Quidditch pitch without having to follow signs.<ref name="OOTP19">{{OOTP|B|19}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Derrick was evidently an accomplished and talented [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player, given how he was appointed as a [[Beater]] for the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]].<ref name="POA15"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*This character is known only by his surname in the {{HPbooks}}. His first name is given as "Peregrine" in the video game {{QWC}}.
*It is possible that Derrick is the [[Unidentified Slytherin Beater (II)]] seen in {{PS|FA}}, and then played from the [[1991–1992 school year]].

==Etymology==
The name "Peregrine" is from the Late Latin name ''Peregrinus'', which meant "traveller". This was the name of several early saints.
