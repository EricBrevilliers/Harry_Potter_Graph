'''Madam Celestina Warbeck''' (b. [[18 August]]<ref name="Pottermore"/> [[1917]])<ref name="FWC"/> was a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[half-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and popular singer in the [[wizarding world]], often known as "''The Singing Sorceress''". She attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was [[Sorting Ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]].<ref name="Pottermore"/> She was often featured on the show called [[Witching Hour]], which ran on the [[Wizarding Wireless Network]].<ref name="COS3">{{COS|B|3}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Celestina Warbeck was born on [[18 August]]<ref name="Pottermore"/> [[1917]]<ref name="FWC"/> in [[Wales]] to a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] father and a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] mother. Her father, a minor functionary in the [[Department of Muggle Relations]], met her mother, a failed actress, when the latter was attacked by a [[Lethifold]] disguised as a stage curtain.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

Celestina's musical talent was apparent even at an early age; in [[1927]], the wizarding magazine [[Spellbound (magazine)|''Spellbound'']] published an article about her talents when she was around ten years old, referring her as a child prodigy.<ref name="COG">{{COG}} {{See image|File:Spellbound magazine.png}}</ref>

Disappointed to learn that there was no such thing as a wizarding stage school, [[Celestina Warbeck's mother|Mrs Warbeck]] reluctantly let her daughter go to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] (which she attended from [[1928]]-[[1936]] and was [[Sorting Ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]), but frequently bombarded the school with letters to form a theatre club, choir and dancing class to showcase and grow her daughter's innumerable talents and provide more wizards with opportunity to act, sing, and dance.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

===Career as a singer===
[[File:Celestina Warbeck-88-chocFrogCard.png|200px|thumb|Celestina Warbeck as depicted on a bronze [[Chocolate Frog Card]]]]
Frequently appearing with a chorus of backing [[banshee]]s, Celestina's concerts and songs were justly famous. Three devoted fans were involved in a three-broom pile-up over [[Liverpool]] on the last night of her '[[Flighty Aphrodite]]' tour.<ref name="Pottermore"/> Her tickets often went on sale in the black market for vastly inflated prices (one reason why [[Molly Weasley]], who listened to her songs every [[Christmas]],<ref name="HBP16">{{HBP|B|16}}</ref> could never see her favourite singer live).<ref name="Pottermore"/>

Celestina's personal life provided much fodder for the gossip columns of the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''. Warbeck became romantically involved with one of her backing dancers early in her career. They married, but ended up divorcing after only a year. Some time later, she married her [[Celestina Warbeck's second husband|manager]], and they had a [[Celestina Warbeck's son|son]] together. However, after ten years of marriage, Warbeck left him in order to marry [[Irving Warble]], a music composer.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

Celestina sometimes lent her name and talents to good causes, such as raising funds for [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] with a recording of [[Puddlemere United]]'s anthem ''Beat Back Those Bludgers, Boys, and Chuck That Quaffle Here''.<ref name="DPN">{{DP}}</ref><ref name="Pottermore"/> More controversially, Celestina was vocal in her disagreement when the [[Ministry of Magic]] sought to impose restrictions on how the wizarding community was allowed to celebrate [[Hallowe'en]].<ref name="Pottermore"/><ref name="PM-Ministers">{{HPcom|ministers-for-magic}}</ref>

Some of Celestina's best-known songs include ''[[You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me]]'' and ''A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love''. Her fans are usually older people who love her grandstanding style and powerful voice.<ref name="Pottermore"/> The late 20th-century album ''You Stole My Cauldron but You Can't Have My Heart ''was a massive global hit. She also featured heavily on shows at the [[Wizarding Wireless Network]], one such being the ''[[Witching Hour]]'' hosted by [[Glenda Chittock]].<ref name="COS3"/>

Celestina Warbeck had a [[Celestina Warbeck Fan Club|fan club]], established as early as the [[1986–1987 school year]].<ref name="HM33">{{HM|3|3}}</ref>

[[File:Celestina Warbeck in feather boa HM.png|250px|thumb|left|Celestina Warbeck disguised in a feather boa]]
During the [[1988–1989 school year]], Celestina visited Hogwarts in order to host a [[Celestina Warbeck's Hogwarts Quidditch pitch concert|special concert]] on the [[Hogwarts Quidditch pitch]]. [[Albus Dumbledore]] tasked [[Jacob's sibling]] with escorting her from [[Hogsmeade station]] without her drawing the attention of the many witches and wizards present, like [[Rita Skeeter]]. She disguised herself with [[glasses]] and a feather boa. Jacob's sibling met her at the train station and escorted her to Hogwarts without anyone else realising her identity, for which she was thankful for.<ref name="HMCNG">{{HM|5|Celestina's New Groove}}</ref>

[[File:Celestina Warbeck revealing herself to students HM.png|thumb|right|250px|Celestina revealing herself to Hogwarts students]]
Celestina was looking for student singers to perform with her onstage during her concert. Jacob's sibling held auditions in the [[Great Hall]] for which [[Andre Egwu]], [[Badeea Ali]] [[Diego Caplan]] and [[Jae Kim]] attended, but she was in fact most impressed with [[Barnaby Lee]]'s singing voice when she heard him sing "[[Do the Hippogriff]]". She revealed her identity to the students by removing their glasses, and they were all amazed to see her.<ref name="HMCNG"/>

In [[2003]], she allowed a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[dog]]-walker who accidentally took a [[Portkey]] to one of her concerts to join her on the stage for a duet of ''[[A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love]]''; while the [[Memory Charm]] cast on him by a harassed [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] official appeared at first to have erased his [[memory]] of the incident, he afterwards wrote a popular song that greatly resembled Warbeck's hit, something she was not amused about.<ref name="Portkey">{{HPcom|portkeys}}</ref>

In the summer of [[2014]], Celestina Warbeck travelled to the [[Patagonian Desert]] to watch the games of the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup|427th Quidditch World Cup]]. Her presence, alongside other wizarding celebrities, was noted by reporter [[Rita Skeeter]] to have caused "''flurries of excitement''", with crowd members scrambling for autographs and even attempting to cast [[Bridging Charm]]s to reach the VIP boxes.<ref name="PottermoreDP">{{PM}} - [[DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY REUNITES AT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP FINAL|DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY REUNITES AT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP FINAL" (Daily Prophet, 08 July 2014)]]</ref>

Celestina's latest album was entitled ''[[You Stole My Cauldron But You Can't Have My Heart]]''. The promotional tour included a show in [[Liverpool]]; fans desperate to arrive at this concert were involved in a three-broom crash.<ref name="DPN"/><ref name="Pottermore"/>

Warbeck scheduled concerts in [[Exmoor Quidditch Stadium|Exmoor]], sponsored by [[The Sorcerer's Saucepot]]. Tickets were on sale for five [[Wizarding currency|Galleons]] each, and fans had to book their [[Portkey]]s early.<ref name="JKRS">{{JKRS}}</ref>

During the [[Calamity]] in the late [[2010s]] or early [[2020s]], [[Neville Longbottom]] contacted a [[Calamity Investigator]] working for the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] to inform them that stroking, talking, and singing to plants encouraged their growth, with the investigator later using this information to discover that singing Warbeck's greatest hits to [[Dittany]] greatly increased its potency, decreasing the brewing time for their [[Healing Potion]]s.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': In her free time, Celestina enjoyed breeding [[crup]]s, meaning she had a level of talent in the handling of [[magic]]al creatures.<ref name="hobbies">{{PM}} (2014) - Excerpt here: [https://www.today.com/popculture/j-k-rowling-writes-new-harry-potter-story-about-singing-1D80069158 Read J.K. Rowling's new Harry Potter story about a singing sorceress] - "Hobbies: Travelling in fabulous style, breeding rough-coated Crups, relaxing in any of her eight homes"</ref>
*'''Singing skills''': Celestina was a highly popular and talented vocalist, having had a very lucrative career as a pop singer with an impressive discography, along with a huge fan base throughout the [[wizarding world]], proving her abilities as a singer to have been quite legendary.

''Celestina'' possibly comes from the word ''celestial'', meaning "pertaining to the sky or visible heaven." ''Warbeck'' may come from ''warbler'', which is a singing [[bird]].

==Behind the scenes==
*Celestina Warbeck was played by American actress [[Shaullanda Lacombe]] at {{WWHP}}.
*A Celestina Warbeck concert is featured at [[Carkitt Market]], in {{WWHP}}. She sings her never-before-heard songs. The lyrics also contain never-before-revealed information about Celestina's wand, written by [[J. K. Rowling]].<ref name="UO">"''[http://blog.universalorlando.com/whats-new/entertainment-interactive-experiences-wizarding-world-harry-potter-diagon-alley-revealed/ Entertainment and Interactive Experiences in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter – Diagon Alley Revealed]''" at [http://blog.universalorlando.com/ Universal Orlando Close-Up]</ref>
*Warbeck is Rowling's favourite off-stage character; the author imagined her to look and act like {{W|Shirley Bassey}}.<ref name="Pottermore"/> Rowling took the name "Celestina" from a friend with whom she had worked at Amnesty International in London many years, stating that the name was simply begging to be attached to a glamorous witch.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

===Rowling's comments===
"''Celestina is one of my favourite 'off-stage' characters in the whole series, and has been part of the Potter world ever since its inception, making an early appearance in the short-lived 'Daily Prophet' series I produced for members of the equally short-lived fan club run by my British publisher, Bloomsbury. Although we never lay eyes on Celestina during the whole seven volumes of the Potter books, I always imagined her to resemble Shirley Bassey in both looks and style. I stole her first name from a friend with whom I worked, years ago, at Amnesty International's Headquarters in London; 'Celestina' was simply begging to be scooped up and attached to a glamorous witch.''"<ref name="Pottermore"/>
