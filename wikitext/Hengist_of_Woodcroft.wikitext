==Biography==

Hengist was traditionally credited with the founding of the village of [[Hogsmeade]] after being driven from his home by [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] persecutors. According to popular lore, Hengist used the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]] as a home.<ref name="PSvg">{{PS|G}}</ref>

Hengist [[Death|died]] at some point during the [[Middle Ages]]. Remembered for his founding of [[Hogsmeade]], he was immortalised in a [[Chocolate Frog Card]]<ref name="PSvg"/> Hengist of Woodcroft's Chocolate Frog Card was one of the very first collected by [[Harry Potter]].<ref name="ps6">{{PS|B|6}}</ref> There was a bust of Hengist on the [[fourth-floor corridor]] of the [[Hogwarts Castle]].<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref> There was also a statue of Hengist in [[Hogsmeade]] by the [[1890s]].<ref name="HL"/>

On [[1 September]], [[1991]], [[Prefect]] [[Gabriel Truman]] welcomed [[Hufflepuff]] [[First year|first-year]] students to the [[Hufflepuff Basement]] with a short speech in which he mentioned Hengist of Woodcroft as one of the many notable Hogwarts students who had been [[Sorting Ceremony|sorted]], like them, into Hufflepuff.<ref name="pottermore"/>

==Etymology==
The name "Hengist" means "stallion" in Germanic. Hengist and his brother Horsa were the leaders of the first Germanic settlers in Britain, which would grow to become the civilisation of England (distinct from the surrounding Celtic nations of Scotland and Wales). Hengist established a kingdom in [[Kent]] in the [[First millennium A.D.|5th century]].

==Behind the scenes==
*{{HL}} shows the foundation of Hogsmeade in [[First millennium A.D.|914]], suggesting that Hengist was alive by that time.<ref name="HL">{{HL}}</ref> This is anachronistic, however, as [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] did not exist until 990, which Hengist was known to attend.
