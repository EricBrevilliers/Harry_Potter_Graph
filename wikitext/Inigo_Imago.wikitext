==Etymology==
The name "Inigo" is the English form of Iñigo. It became well-known in Britain due to the 17th-century English architect Inigo Jones. He was named after his father, a Catholic who was named for Saint Ignatius of Loyola.

"Imago" is the technical term for a mature insect. It may also be a play on the word "image," which is part of the visions that Seers experience to see the future.
