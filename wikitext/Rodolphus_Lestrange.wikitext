'''Rodolphus Lestrange''' was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and a member of the [[pure-blood]] [[Lestrange family]]. He, along with his brother [[Rabastan Lestrange|Rabastan]], joined the [[Death Eaters]] and fought in the [[First Wizarding War]]. The [[Lestrange family|Lestranges]] were considered to be among [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s most loyal and trusted servants and were the only ones along with Barty Crouch Jnr who searched for him after his first downfall.

After Voldemort was defeated by Harry Potter when Harry was only a baby, Rodolphus and his wife [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], along with Rabastan and [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] participated in the [[Attack on Frank and Alice Longbottom|torture and permanent incapacitation]] of [[Alice Longbottom|Alice]] and [[Frank Longbottom]] and was sentenced to life imprisonment in [[Azkaban]]. 

About fourteen years later, Rodolphus escaped with a group of other Death Eaters and fought in several battles of the [[Second Wizarding War]], including the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] and the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]. After Lord Voldemort's final defeat, Rodolphus was imprisoned in Azkaban once more.

In [[2020]], he escaped from Azkaban once again, and set to look for Voldemort and Bellatrix's illegitimate daughter, [[Delphini]], informing her of her destiny and heritage.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Rodolphus Lestrange was born to the [[pure-blood]] [[Lestrange family]],<ref name="OOTP6"/> prior to [[1953]].

===Hogwarts years===
When Rodolphus attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], he was [[Sorting Ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Slytherin]] [[Hogwarts House|House]]. He became friends with many other pure-blood students and, according to [[Sirius Black]], joined a [[Gang of Slytherins|group of friends]] that included many future [[Death Eaters]] like [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Black]], [[Lucius Malfoy]], [[Evan Rosier]], and [[Severus Snape]].<ref name="GOF27">{{GOF|B|27}}</ref>

===First Wizarding War {{C|1970-1981}}===
He and Bellatrix eventually married sometime before 1970<ref>The First Wizarding War began in 1970, so they were married by then as they are referred to as "The Lestranges" at that time.</ref> and both took the [[Dark Mark]], fighting in the [[First Wizarding War]]. She married him only to uphold [[House of Black|her family]]'s tradition of marrying respectable [[pure-blood]]s. She was obsessively in [[love]] with [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. It is unknown how Rodolphus felt about her. However, the two did seem to work together effectively as Death Eaters.

[[File:B4C30M1 Wizengamot trial Pensieve memory.png|250px|thumb|left|The trial of Rodolphus along with his wife Bellatrix, Barty Crouch Jnr and Rabastan by the [[Council of Magical Law]]]]

After [[Hallowe'en]] night of [[1981]], when Lord Voldemort was [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1981)|defeated for the first time]], Rodolphus and his wife refused to accept it, having supposedly "talked their way" out of a prison sentence in [[Azkaban]]. Along with Rodolphus's brother [[Rabastan Lestrange|Rabastan]] and [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]], they [[Attack on Frank and Alice Longbottom|attacked]] [[Auror]]s and [[Order of the Phoenix]] members [[Alice Longbottom|Alice]] and [[Frank Longbottom]].<ref name="GOF30"/> 

They tortured the couple with the [[Cruciatus Curse]] to the point of [[insanity]], and they were subsequently captured and imprisoned in Azkaban prison for this crime. Upon [[Trial of the Lestranges and Bartemius Crouch Junior|their trial]], the [[Lestrange family|Lestranges]] proudly declared their continuing devotion and awaited their master's return, believing that their allegiance would see them rewarded by Voldemort upon his return.<ref name="GOF30">{{GOF|B|30}}</ref>

===Second Wizarding War {{C|1996-1998}}===
{{Main|Second Wizarding War}}
In [[1996]], the [[Dementor]]s of Azkaban revolted, and Rodolphus and Bellatrix [[Azkaban escapes#1996|escaped]] prison along with eight other Death Eaters, including his brother [[Rabastan Lestrange|Rabastan]] to rejoin Voldemort, who had regained his powers and was stronger than before thanks to Wormtail and Barty Crouch Jnr.<ref name="OOTP25">{{OOTP|B|25}}</ref>

====Battle of the Department of Mysteries====
{{Quote|We'll split into pairs and search, and don't forget, be gentle with Potter until we've got the prophecy, you can kill the others if you feel necessary – Bellatrix, Rodolphus, you take the left...|[[Lucius Malfoy]] gives orders to the group of Death Eaters.|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:B5C34M1 Death Eaters attacking Department of Mysteries - Pottemore moment.jpg|250px|thumb|Rabastan and fellow Death Eaters standing in the [[Hall of Prophecy]]]]
Rodolphus participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] soon afterwards; he and Bellatrix were paired together, and pursued [[Luna Lovegood]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] into the [[Department of Mysteries#Space Chamber|Space Chamber]] along with two other Death Eaters. He was likely one of the Death Eaters who went on to fight the [[Order of the Phoenix]] in the [[Death Chamber]].<ref name="OOTP35">{{OOTP|B|35}}</ref> In the aftermath, Rodolphus was returned to prison, although his wife eluded capture.

====Battle of the Seven Potters====
[[File:Sky battle & death eater chase.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Rodolphus participated in the Battle of the Seven Potters]]
By [[1997]], Rodolphus was again at large. Along with his wife and other Death Eaters, he participated in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] and pursued [[Nymphadora Tonks]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], the latter of whom was disguised as [[Harry Potter]] under [[Polyjuice Potion]]. Tonks injured Rodolphus at some point during the pursuit, and she and Ron escaped.<ref name="DH5">{{DH|B|5}}</ref>

During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] the [[1998|following year]], Rodolphus lost his [[Bellatrix Lestrange|wife]], who was [[Duel between Molly Weasley and Bellatrix Lestrange|killed]] by [[Molly Weasley]], thus making Lestrange a widower.<ref name="DH36">{{DH|B|36}}</ref> What happened to Rodolphus during the battle remained unknown, but he was eventually imprisoned again for his crimes.

===Post-war===
Sometime in between the war's end and [[2020]], Rodolphus escaped from Azkaban for the third time and sought out the daughter of his former master, [[Delphini]]. Rodolphus revealed Delphi's heritage to her and it is currently unknown what  became of him, as he didn't appear to be involved with Delphini's plan to use [[Albus Potter]] to bring back [[Tom Riddle|her father]].<ref name="CC411">{{CC|B|4|11}}</ref>

==Physical description==
Rodolphus was a tall, thickset man with very dark hair. However, after being in Azkaban, he appeared thin and his looks might have diminished. As a Death Eater, he bore the Dark Mark on his left inner forearm, which faded to a scar upon Voldemort's death.

==Personality and traits ==
Rodolphus was one of Voldemort's most loyal [[Death Eaters]] and therefore can be considered to be sadistic and a [[pure-blood]] supremacist. His crime against the Longbottoms confirms his willingness to use the [[Dark Arts]] to an unspeakable extent. He might not have been concerned at all about being sent to Azkaban as he "stared blankly" throughout the course of his trial, possibly sharing Bellatrix's belief that Voldemort would return and free them.<ref name="GOF30"/> He did not show any resent towards his wife for having an affair with Voldemort, and even went onto notifying their daughter, Delphini, on her heritage and destiny. He didn't talk very often and, unlike his wife, he seemed to be an extremely serious person who barely even smiled.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Rodolphus was skilled with the [[Cruciatus Curse]], having used it to torture Alice and Frank Longbottom into [[insanity]].<ref name="GOF30"/>
*'''[[Duelling]]''': As one of Voldemort's top Death Eaters he likely took part in many battles during both wars against trained [[Auror]]s and [[Order of the Phoenix]] members. He was one of the Death Eaters to capture [[Frank Longbottom|Frank]] and [[Alice Longbottom]] (both being skilled [[Auror]]s). He participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] where he fought against the Order members who arrived,<ref name="OOTP35"/> though he was defeated and captured following the battle. He also fought in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] but was defeated and injured by his niece [[Nymphadora Tonks]].<ref name="DH5"/>
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': In the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], he duelled his niece, [[Nymphadora Tonks]] during flight in a losing effort.<ref name="DH5"/>

==Relationships==
===Bellatrix Lestrange===
[[File:Bellatrix Lestrange promo.jpg|right|thumb|245px|[[Bellatrix Lestrange]], his wife]]
In marrying Bellatrix Black, Rodolphus made a "''respectable [[pure-blood]] marriage''",<ref name="OOTP6">{{OOTP|B|6}}</ref> as was expected of him. There is no indication that their relationship went beyond this. However, she and Rodolphus did seem to work effectively together as Death Eaters. They also were part of the same [[Gang of Slytherins|social circle]] at Hogwarts.<ref name="GOF27"/> 

The two appeared to be united in their attempt to search for their disappeared master, in which they together [[Cruciatus Curse|tortured]] [[Alice Longbottom|Alice]] and [[Frank Longbottom]] alongside his [[Rabastan Lestrange|brother]], and [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] in [[1981]].<ref name="GOF30" /> He fought with Bellatrix during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]].<ref name="OOTP35" /> He was also with her during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], as [[Nymphadora Tonks]] mentioned cursing him and being pursued by Bellatrix.<ref name="DH5" /> Sirius Black described them as part of the same "gang of Slytherins" at Hogwarts, which also included [[Lucius Malfoy]], [[Evan Rosier]] and [[Severus Snape]].<ref name="GOF27" />

Bellatrix once told Narcissa that if she had sons, she would "''be glad to give them up to the service of the Dark Lord''".<ref name="HBP2">{{HBP|B|2}}</ref>

No children appear beneath Bellatrix's and Rodolphus's names on the [[House of Black|Black family tapestry]], indicating that she had no daughters with Rodolphus either. However, Roldolphus did allow Bellatrix to have access to his [[Lestrange Vault|family's vault]] at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] upon marriage, as Bellatrix referred it as "''[my] vault''".<ref name="DH23">{{DH|B|23}}</ref>

It was later revealed that Bellatrix had a daughter named [[Delphini]] with [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]].<ref name="CC411"/> This indicates that Bellatrix didn't have much marital loyalty to Rodolphus at this time. It is entirely possible that Rodolphus approved his wife's relationship with their master, as the Lestranges worshipped Voldemort, furthering that their relationship as a couple is strictly professional.

===Lord Voldemort===
Rodolphus was shown to be loyal to Lord Voldemort along with the rest of his family. During the First Wizarding War, he was one of Voldemort's most trusted followers, along with his wife.<ref name="GOF30"/> His loyalty was strong enough that he continued to seek out his fallen master upon his disappearance, something [[Bellatrix Lestrange|only]] [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|three]] [[Rabastan Lestrange|others]] were known to do. Voldemort himself regarded Rodolphus as a faithful follower, speaking of him and his wife approvingly to the Death Eaters at the [[Little Hangleton graveyard]].<ref name="GOF33">{{GOF|B|33}}</ref>

===Delphini===
Delphi, Rodolphus's stepdaughter, claimed that Rodolphus found her after many years of him being in prison.<ref name="CC411"/> It is unknown what sort of relationship he had with his wife's daughter.

==Etymology==
{{W|Rodolphus}} is the Latin form of the name 'Rudolf', which is derived from the Germanic name ''Hrodwulf'', meaning "famous wolf".<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/rudolf Behind the Name: Rudolf]</ref> This may allude to prominent Nazi {{w|Rudolf Hess}}, as the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] ideology has similarities to those of Nazism, according to [[J. K. Rowling]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060316221500/https://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=58 F.A.Q. Section] at {{JKRS}}</ref> Removing the l, Rodophus is Greek for 'Rosy-cheeked'.

==Behind the scenes==
*[[J. K. Rowling]] has revealed that [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]'s true love was [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]],<ref>[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript 30 July 2007 WebChat with J.K. Rowling]</ref> suggesting that the Lestranges' marriage was not affectionate, at least on the part of Bellatrix, who merely made "a respectable pure-blood marriage", as was expected of her. Rodolphus's feelings are not known.
*In {{HBP}}, someone by the surname "Lestrange" is shown having gone to school with [[Tom Riddle]]. It is unknown if this person is Rodolphus's father or another relative.
*It's unknown if Rodolphus was aware of Voldemort giving [[Hufflepuff's Cup|Helga Hufflepuff's Cup]] to Bellatrix, or if he was aware of its presence in his [[Lestrange Vault|family vault]].
*Rodolphus may have been a [[Seer]], as he told Delphini a Prophecy of the Dark Lord's return.
