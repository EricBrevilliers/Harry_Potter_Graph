{{Quote|Everard and Dilys were two of Hogwarts's most celebrated Heads. Their renown is such that both have portraits hanging in other important Wizarding institutions. As they are free to move between their own portraits they can tell us what may be happening elsewhere....|Albus Dumbledore telling Harry Potter about Derwent and [[Everard]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
'''Professor Dilys Derwent''' (d. [[1768]])<ref name="OP22"/> was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who worked as a [[Healer]] at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] and was a celebrated [[Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Headmistress]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Her [[portrait]] hung not only in the [[Headmaster's office]] along with the [[Headmaster portraits|portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses]], but also in [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]]' main admitting area.<ref name="OP22"/> She was immortalised on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]].

He looks bad....|Albus Dumbledore communicating with Derwent's portrait|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
When [[Arthur Weasley]] was [[Attack on Arthur Weasley|attacked]] by Voldemort's [[snake]] [[Nagini]] in the [[Department of Mysteries]] in late [[1995]], [[Albus Dumbledore]], then-[[Headteacher|Headmaster]], asked Derwent to go to her portrait at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]]'s main admitting area in order to keep Dumbledore apprised on Mr Weasley's condition.<ref name="OP22"/>

When [[Harry Potter]] went to the [[Headmaster's office]], shortly after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Voldemort's Last Stand|defeat]] and the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Dilys Derwent joined the ovation made by the previous Hogwarts Headmasters, sobbing unashamedly.<ref name="DH36">{{DH|B|36}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Healing magic]]''': As a professional [[Healer]] who worked at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]], Derwent would have been accomplished with healing.<ref name="OP22"/>

==Etymology==
The name "Dilys" means "genuine" in Welsh. Derwent may be from the name of an English lake in Cumbria, in the Lake District called "Derwent Water".
