'''Madam Puddifoot''' (fl. [[1980s]]<ref name="HM"/>–[[2010s]])<ref name="WU"/> was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who ran [[Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop]] in [[Hogsmeade]].<ref name="OOTP25"/>

==Biography==
In the [[1980s]], Puddifoot was introduced to [[Jacob's sibling]] by [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Nymphadora Tonks]].<ref name="HM">{{HM}}</ref>

She participated in the [[Hogsmeade Festival]] during the [[1987–1988 school year]], where she had a stand that was destroyed by [[Ismelda Murk]] along with the rest of the festival stands. She was fearful that her favourite teapot had been destroyed and approached Jacob's sibling and their friends for help. Jacob's sibling managed to find the teapot, for which Madam Puddifoot thanked them.<ref name="HMF">{{HM|4|Hogsmeade Festival}}</ref>

On [[Valentine's day]] in [[1996]], Puddifoot decorated her shop by placing several golden [[cherub]]s around and had them throw confetti over visiting couples every so often. She served coffee to the couple [[Harry Potter]] and [[Cho Chang]].<ref name="OOTP25">{{OOTP|B|25}}</ref>

===Problems in Hogsmeade===
[[File:Madam Puddifoot MA.png|thumb|250px|right|Madam Puddifoot in 2010]]
In December [[2010]], Madam Puddifoot spoke to [[Tiburon Merriweather's great-grandchild|a student]] outside of her shop. She told the student it was hard to be happy with the recent [[werewolf]] problem the village was experiencing. Although it hadn't been confirmed that werewolves were responsible, it appears Madam Puddifoot thought [[Renka]]'s claims were possible. When the student responded they thought it was just a rumour, she responded that it was better to be safe than sorry and advised them to be careful about the company they keep, pointing out people weren't always what they appeared to be.<ref>{{MA}}</ref>

===The Calamity===
By at least the late [[2010s]], during the [[Calamity]], volunteer members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] met with Madam Puddifoot to try to convince her to join the SOS Task Force officially. She enthusiastically agreed and informed all staff to do whatever necessary to help support the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]'s efforts. Madam Puddifoot also met with a [[Calamity Investigator]] working for the task force and discussed the finer points of brewing tea with them. The investigator was inspired by the information gained from this conversation to steep [[vervain]] in boiling water to create a stronger infusion, reducing the brewing time for their [[Invigoration Draught]].<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>

==Physical description ==
Puddifoot was a very stout woman with brown eyes and a shiny black bun.<ref name="OOTP25" />

==Personality and traits ==
{{Quote|My dear child, nothing in my shop is clutter! It's all deliberately setup to bring people together.|Madam Puddifoot to the [[Tiburon Merriweather's great-grandchild|unidentified Muggle-born Hogwarts student]]|Harry Potter: Magic Awakened}}
Puddifoot was quite lonely, which was why she cluttered a lot of stuff in her shop to create a warm environment and help bring people together. She enjoyed serving her customers to ease her of loneliness.<ref name="MA">{{MA}}</ref> She was known for having strong opinions, with a [[Calamity Investigator]] claiming that her opinions were "as strong as her [[Tea|Darjeeling]]."<ref name="WU" />

==Possessions==
*'''[[Wand]]''': Like all witches, Madam Puddifoot possessed a wand of unknown properties.
*'''[[Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop]]''': She was the owner of the teashop that bore her name.
*'''[[Madam Puddifoot's teapot|Teapot]]''': She owned a special teapot which she only brought out for special occasions.

==Behind the scenes==
* It is possible she, alongside her fellow [[Hogsmeade]] residents, participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], as [[Horace Slughorn]] was recruiting them and [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] declared a final stand for the entire [[Second Wizarding War]].<ref name="DH36">{{DH|B|36}}</ref>
*In the Epic Universe expansion of {{WWHP}}, in the [[Metrofloo]] in [[Paris]] there is a poster advertising "''Beau thé bleu d'Occamy''" (beautiful blue Occamy tea), with the name "Madame Piedoddu" (Puddifoot's name in the French translation of the books) visible on the poster.<ref>{{WWHP}} {{See video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK2FYsb-x7M&t=96s}}</ref> It is possible that this means there is a branch of Madam Puddifoot's in Paris, as it would be unusual for a small tea shop in the Scottish Highlands to be advertised in Paris.
