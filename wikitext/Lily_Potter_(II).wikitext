[[2008]]) was an [[England|English]] [[half-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], the youngest child and only daughter of [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginevra Potter]] {{c|née [[Weasley family|Weasley]]}}. Lily had two older brothers, [[James Potter (II)|James Sirius]] and [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus Potter]]. She was named in honour of her late paternal grandmother, [[Lily Potter (I)|Lily Potter]], and her middle name came from her parents' good friend [[Luna Lovegood]].

Lily began her education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in 2019 along with her cousin, [[Hugo Granger-Weasley]], and was [[Sorting Ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]].

==Biography==

===Early life (2008-2019)===
Lily Luna Potter was born to Harry and Ginevra Potter, as their youngest child and only daughter. She had two older brothers: [[James Potter (II)|James Sirius]] and [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus Potter]]. Lily was around two years younger than Albus, and four years younger than James.

In 2014, Lily, along with her family, attended the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup final]] in the Patagonian Desert. Lily was sporting Bulgarian red, along with the majority of her family. It should also be noted that she was very well behaved, as [[Rita Skeeter]], a poison-pen journalist who found something nasty to say about everyone, not make any scathing comments regarding her behaviour.

[[File:Harry Potter Epilogue.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Lily with her family at Platform 9¾ in 2017]]
In 2017, she went to see her brothers and her cousin, [[Rose Granger-Weasley]], off at the [[Hogwarts Express]], but was not herself old enough to attend [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. She and her cousin, [[Hugo Granger-Weasley]], were around the same age. Hugo and Lily talked excitedly about which house they wanted to be in at Hogwarts.

===Hogwarts years (2019-)===
In [[2019]], Lily began her education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was [[Sorting Ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]].<ref name="CC">{{CC|1}}</ref> In [[2020]], she was seen on [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters|Platform 9¾]] along with the rest of her family, sitting on her older brother's trolley.

==Physical description==
Lily inherited the red hair of her mother's [[Weasley family|family]],<ref name="DH-E"/> and had inherited most of the Weasleys' physical traits, as well, not just her hair colour. Her most notable characteristic trait was her cheery-looking smile, which was possibly inherited from [[Lily Potter (I)|Lily Potter]], her late grandmother, who had a very prominent smile as well.

==Personality and traits==
Lily seemed to have a personality similar to her mother. She was very jealous of her two older brothers when they were leaving for [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], quite similar to the eagerness and envy Ginny displayed when the last of her brothers went away to school in [[1991]].

Lily also seemed to enjoy talking to her family. She and her cousin [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo]] had an "animated discussion" about what house they would be in, suggesting they were very close.

==Relationships==
===Family===
====The Potters====
{{Quote|...the redheaded girl trailed tearfully behind her brothers, clutching her father's arm.|Lily tightly holding her father's hand|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Potter family1.png|251x251px|thumb|left|Lily with her older siblings and parents]]
Lily had a close relationship with her father and her mother. She resembled her mother, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], in appearance and personality. Lily also seemed to [[love]] her father dearly, as she held hands with him in [[2017]] and looked towards him for comfort. During the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup]], Lily sat to close her [[Harry Potter|father]] and stared up at him in what appeared to be admiration.<ref name="PM">{{PM}}</ref>

[[James Potter (II)|James]] had a fondness for teasing his younger siblings, including Lily, who reciprocated his care and humourous attitude to both her brothers. When Lily went to see her brothers off to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], she seemed to be close to her brother [[James Potter (II)|James Sirius]] and was hugging him at [[King's Cross Station|Kings Cross Station]].<ref name="DH-E"/>

====The Weasleys====
[[File:Granger-Weasley family on Platform 9¾ DHF2.jpg|250x250px|thumb|left|Granger-Weasley family]]
Lily was around the same age as [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo]], and excitedly discussed [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] with him in [[2017]], suggesting they may have been close. Lily was also very excited when she found out her cousin [[Victoire Weasley]] was dating [[Edward Lupin|Teddy Lupin]].

===Teddy Lupin===
[[Edward Lupin|Teddy Lupin]] was Lily's father's godson. He often spent time at the Potters' home, and Lily was very excited at the news that he was dating her cousin [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]]. She hoped that they might marry so that Teddy would become an official member of the family. This was very similar to Ginny's longing to have [[Nymphadora Tonks]] (Teddy's late mother) in her family, deepening the connection between Lily and her mother.

==Etymology==
*The given name ''Lily'' comes from the name of the flower, which is a symbol of purity. Specifically, the lily is often associated with the Virgin Mary; one type of flower is known as the Madonna lily. Greek mythology also links lilies to the Muses and to the goddess Hera, and the flowers continue to be representative of purity and love in Europe. In Chinese, the lily is a play on words for "forever in love", and the flowers were thought to be capable of averting evil.
*''Luna'' means "[[moon]]" in Latin. It is also the name of the Ancient Roman goddess of the moon who was the mother of the Menae, fifty goddesses who embodied the phases of the moon used by the Ancient Greeks to keep time. In some myths, she was also the mother of the Nemean Lion.
*''Potter'' is a very common surname of English origin. It traditionally refers to the occupation of making pottery. Beatrix Potter was a well-known English children's author. Potter's Field is the name for a burial ground for the unknown or unclaimed dead, particularly soldiers and orphans; the Potter family had many members that fit that description. The Potter Box is a model for making ethical decisions developed at Harvard University.
*She was named after important people in her father and mother's life. Lily – after his mother and her paternal grandmother, [[Lily Potter (I)|Lily Evans]], who died to protect Harry from [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] when he was just a baby. Luna – after [[Luna Lovegood]], Ginny's good friend at Hogwarts. Many people believed the name Luna to come from [[Remus Lupin]], but this was disproven by [[J. K. Rowling]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/606878809829310464?lang=en J.K. Rowling's Twitter]</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Lily Luna Potter Lego.jpg|thumb|Lily Potter as a LEGO minifigure]]
*[[Daphne de Beistegui]] portrays Lily Potter in {{DH|F2}}.
*Lily is portrayed by British actresses [[Christiana Hutchings]], [[Zoe Brough]], and [[Cristina Fray]] alternating the role in {{CC|P1}}.<ref>[http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/cursed-child-new-feature-reveals-first-look-at-harry-ron-and-hermione-together-104610/ 'Cursed Child' new feature reveals first look at Harry, Ron & Hermione together.] ''SnitchSeeker.'' 13 July 2016. Retrieved 26 July 2016.</ref><ref>Rowling, J.K., Tiffany, John and Thorne, Jack. ''Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: Parts One and Two.'' Broadway, New York, NY: Arhur A. Levine Books, 2016. Print. pp. 313-15.</ref>
*Lily was the first of Harry's children to be introduced in the epilogue, where she was shown holding her father's hand, much as her [[Ginevra Weasley|mother]] was introduced in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]]''.
*She is the only child of [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and Ginny who was named after a person still living at the end of the series: [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]] still lived while [[Lily Potter (I)|Lily]], [[James Potter (I)|James]], [[Sirius Black|Sirius]], [[Albus Dumbledore|Albus]], and [[Severus Snape|Severus]] all had died.
*In the film version, Lily is seen standing with James, even sitting on top of his trunk when he was taking it into King's Cross.
*In the novel, Lily protests about her desire to go to Hogwarts, despite not being able to go for another two years. This is very similar to the desire her mother, Ginny, expressed in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]].''
*She is related to the [[House of Black]] because her maternal great-grandmother was [[Cedrella Black]]. Her maternal great-grandaunt was [[Lucretia Black]]. Some sort of relative on her paternal side was [[Dorea Black]].
*She is also related to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and the Gaunts through her paternal ancestor [[Ignotus Peverell]]. Ignotus Peverell's brother was [[Cadmus Peverell]] who is Voldemort's ancestor.
*Apparently Lily inherited her impatient and enthusiastic traits from Ginny, because when Harry and Ron were going on the [[Hogwarts Express]], Ginny asked her mother, Molly, if she could go, much like Lily told her father Harry that she wanted to go when Albus and James were going.
