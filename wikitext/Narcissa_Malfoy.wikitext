{{Quote|There is nothing I wouldn't do any more!|Narcissa after her son is put in danger|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
'''Narcissa "Cissy" Malfoy''' (née '''Black''') (b. [[1955]]) was an English [[pure-blood]]<ref name="blood"/> [[Wizardkind|witch]] and a member of the noble [[House of Black]]. She was the youngest daughter of [[Cygnus Black (III)|Cygnus]] and [[Druella Black]] and the younger sister of [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] and [[Andromeda Tonks]]. She married [[Lucius Malfoy]] and they had a son: [[Draco Malfoy]]. 

Although never officially a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] herself, Narcissa believed in the importance of [[Blood status|blood purity]] and supported her husband in following [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] during the [[First Wizarding War|First]] and [[Second Wizarding War]]s.<ref name="Online Chat">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0730-bloomsbury-chat.html Online Chat with JK]</ref> This changed, however, when her husband was incarcerated in [[Azkaban]] and her son's life was put in jeopardy by Voldemort. 

Narcissa took necessary measures to protect her family, including lying to Voldemort about [[Harry Potter]] being dead during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], an act which saved the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]] from serving time in Azkaban following the Dark Lord's defeat.<ref name="Online Chat"/>

Narcissa survived the final battle of the Second Wizarding War and later had a grandson, [[Scorpius Malfoy|Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy]], through her son's marriage to [[Astoria Malfoy|Astoria Greengrass]]. However, Narcissa was not too fond of Astoria for her stance on blood tolerance, believing her to be somewhat of a disappointment to the Malfoy lineage.

== Biography==
===Early life===
Narcissa Black was the youngest daughter of [[Cygnus Black (III)|Cygnus]] and [[Druella Black]] (née [[Rosier family|Rosier]]), born in [[1955]] in the aristocratic [[House of Black]]. She had two older sisters, [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] and [[Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]].<ref name="BFT">Black family tree</ref> Narcissa was taught the philosophy of [[Blood status|blood purity]] from a young age and grew up prejudiced in favour of [[pure-blood]]s.<ref name="OOTP6" /> Thus, like her sister Bellatrix, she cut off contact with her sister Andromeda after the latter was disowned and burned off the [[House of Black#Family Tree|Black family tree]] for marrying [[Muggle-born]] wizard [[Edward Tonks|Ted Tonks]].<ref name="DH1">{{DH|B|1}}</ref>

When she was younger, her mother, Druella Black, sang her a lullaby which was passed down in the Black family.<ref name="AHH">{{HM|3|ANDROMEDA'S HOGWARTS HOMECOMING}}</ref>

===Hogwarts years===
[[File:Narcissa, Andromeda, and Bellatrix.jpeg|230px|thumb|left|A young Narcissa (left) with her older sisters, [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] and [[Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]]]]
Narcissa was educated at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from c. [[1966]]-[[1973]]. Sorted into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]], she met her future husband, [[Lucius Malfoy]], whilst at Hogwarts.<ref name="Slytherin" /> Whilst she was at Hogwarts she was very close with her two sisters, and the three were almost inseparable. They shared a [[Black sisters' keepsake box|keepsake box]] in which they kept their most prized possessions, with Narcissa keeping the [[Malfoy family brooch]] that Lucius had given her when he was courting her in the box.<ref name="AHH" />

She may have been aware of the wanderings of the [[Marauders]], the same group to which her first cousin, [[Sirius Black]], belonged. However, as Sirius was considered a "[[blood traitor]]" by her family, she likely interacted little or not at all with him, just like her [[Bellatrix Lestrange|older sister]].

===First Wizarding War===
{{Main|First Wizarding War}}
Narcissa married [[Lucius Malfoy]], who was just as wealthy and pure-blood-inclined as the Black family Narcissa descended from, between [[1972]] and [[September]] [[1979]].<ref>The first date, 1972, is when Narcissa turned 17 and was eligible for marriage; the second date, September 1979, is nine months before Draco's birth, at which point she had to be married to Lucius.</ref> Together, they lived a life of privilege and luxury at [[Malfoy Manor]], located in the southern English county of [[Wiltshire]].<ref name="DH1" /> Her husband introduced Narcissa to the lifestyle of the [[Death Eaters]], though she never became a Death Eater herself. The couple had one son, named [[Draco Malfoy|Draco Lucius]]. In naming Draco, Narcissa continued her family tradition of naming children after stars and constellations, like her sisters (Bellatrix and Andromeda).

Narcissa's cousin [[Regulus Black]] was killed in the [[First Wizarding War]], while her other cousin [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] and sister Bellatrix were both sentenced to [[Azkaban]] after Voldemort's fall in [[1981]].<ref name="OOTP6">{{OOTP|B|6}}</ref> Lucius was able to avoid a similar fate by falsely claiming that he had been under the effects of the [[Imperius Curse]],<ref name="GOF33">{{GOF|B|33}}</ref><ref name="GOF37">{{GOF|B|37}}</ref> and the Malfoys remained members of the social elite, enjoying close relationships with [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] officials such as [[Minister for Magic]] [[Cornelius Fudge]]<ref name="GOF37"/><ref name="OOTP8">{{OOTP|B|8}}</ref> and Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic [[Dolores Umbridge]].<ref name="OOTP32">{{OOTP|B|32}}</ref> In privacy, however, they regretted the downfall of Voldemort as they saw the purification of the wizarding race to have failed completely, regrets that they told their son not to reveal, lest it would bring their family trouble.

===Between the wars===
After her sister, [[Andromeda Tonks]], opened the [[Black sisters' keepsake box|keepsake box]] during the [[1986–1987 school year]], she sent the brooch inside back to Narcissa.<ref name="AHH" />

[[File:NarcissaLookingOverShoulder Still.jpg|240px|thumb|Narcissa and her grandeur appearance during this time|alt=]]
When the time came for [[Draco Malfoy]] to begin school in [[1991]], Lucius Malfoy wanted him to attend [[Durmstrang Institute]], which only admitted [[pure-blood]] and [[half-blood]] students and taught the [[Dark Arts (class)|Dark Arts]], closely mirroring the Malfoy family beliefs. Narcissa, however, insisted that Draco attend [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] instead so he would be closer to home, as Durmstrang was located in northern Europe and Hogwarts was in Britain, where they lived.<ref name="GOF11">{{GOF|B|11}}</ref> She was very devoted to Draco, sending him sweets and cakes by [[owl]] every day during his first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].<ref name="PS9">{{PS|B|9}}</ref><ref name="GOF13" />

Narcissa attended the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]] in [[August]] [[1994]] with her husband and son, watching the game from Fudge's luxury box.<ref name="GOF8"/>

{{Main|Second Wizarding War}}
[[File:Callejonmalfoys.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Narcissa and Draco after their fall from grace and Lucius' imprisonment|alt=]]
In early [[1996]], following [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s return to power, her sister Bellatrix and brother-in-law [[Rodolphus Lestrange (II)|Rodolphus Lestrange]] escaped [[Azkaban]]. Later that year, Lucius participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] in an attempt to acquire a [[Sybill Trelawney's prophecy (1980)|prophecy]] for Lord Voldemort.<ref name="OOTP35">{{OOTP|B|35}}</ref> Narcissa was able to provide Voldemort with the information needed to lure Harry there after obtaining it from [[Kreacher]], the [[House of Black|Black]] family house-elf, who gave it to her both because she was a Black by birth and because she treated the attention-starved house-elf more kindly than her cousin [[Sirius Black]], the elf's current master, did.<ref name="OOTP37">{{OOTP|B|37}}</ref> 

The effort was thwarted by six [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] members and members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]].<ref name="OOTP35" /> Voldemort was furious with Lucius, who had led the effort, both for failing to obtain the prophecy and for the consequences of that night,<ref name="HBP2" /> which included the Dark Lord's return being formally recognised by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]<ref name="OOTP36">{{OOTP|B|36}}</ref> and many of his Death Eaters being sent to Azkaban, including Lucius himself.<ref name="OOTP38">{{OOTP|B|38}}</ref>

Though her sister Bellatrix managed to escape imprisonment, Narcissa was distraught over her husband's incarceration, as well as Voldemort's subsequent treatment of her family. That summer, she ventured to [[Severus Snape]]'s home at [[Spinner's End]], accompanied by Bellatrix, to discuss Voldemort's orders for Draco to murder Hogwarts Headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]].<ref name="HBP2">{{HBP|B|2}}</ref>

[[File:B6C2M1 Narcissa Severus Bellatrix Unbreakable Vow.jpg|250px|thumb|alt=|[[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] creating an [[Unbreakable Vow]] between Narcissa and Severus in order to protect Draco]]
Narcissa was hysterical and theorised that Draco was being sent on a suicide mission to punish Lucius for his numerous failures. Despite Bellatrix's insistence that Snape was not to be trusted, she begged him to make an [[Unbreakable Vow]], which ensured that he would watch over Draco during his efforts. She also made him vow to execute the plan himself, should Draco fail to do so.<ref name="HBP2" />

Later that month, Narcissa went shopping for school supplies with Draco at [[Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions]], where she had a heated confrontation with [[Harry Potter]] and his friends. He taunted her about Lucius's imprisonment, and she responded by coldly alluding to the recent death of [[Sirius Black|his godfather]], after which she haughtily departed with her son to [[Twilfitt and Tattings]], as she did not wish to shop at Madam Malkin's anymore.<ref name="HBP6">{{HBP|B|6}}</ref>

Throughout the school year, Draco enacted a series of unsuccessful attempts to kill Dumbledore, which eventually resulted in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] and Snape's fulfilment of his vow to Narcissa.<ref name="HBP27">{{HBP|B|27}}</ref>

====Home as headquarters====
[[File:DH1_Lucius_Malfoy,_Narcissa_Malfoy_and_Bellatrix_Lestrange.jpg|245px|thumb|left|Lucius, Narcissa, and her sister Bellatrix talking to Lord Voldemort during the [[Meeting at Malfoy Manor]]|alt=]]

By [[1997]], Malfoy Manor was being used as a headquarters for Voldemort. A [[Meeting at Malfoy Manor|meeting]] of Lord Voldemort's inner circle was held there, and the murder of [[Charity Burbage]] took place in the drawing room. The Malfoys were extremely uncomfortable with the arrangements, despite their claims that nothing would please them more than to host the Dark Lord. When Lord Voldemort asked Lucius for [[Lucius Malfoy's first wand|his wand]], he showed some hesitance in giving away his only weapon and means of defence; however, when Narcissa grasped his hand under the table, silently persuading him to accede to the Dark Lord, he relented. Lucius's wand was soon broken in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]].<ref name="DH1" />

Voldemort was still displeased with the Malfoys for Lucius's earlier failures and delighted in humiliating them by taunting their relation to [[werewolf]] [[Remus Lupin]] through Narcissa's niece, [[Nymphadora Tonks]].<ref name="DH1" />

====Skirmish at Malfoy Manor====

When [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] were caught by a group of [[Snatchers]] led by [[Fenrir Greyback|Greyback]], they were brought to [[Malfoy Manor]]. Narcissa acted coldly and disdainfully towards [[Scabior]] but let them in, where she called on [[Draco Malfoy|her son]] to identify the prisoners. She herself recognised Hermione from their encounter a year earlier in [[Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions]].<ref name="DH23">{{DH|B|23}}</ref>

Narcissa clashed with her sister over who had authority in her home, and therefore over the prisoners held in her cellar: Harry, Ron, [[Dean Thomas]], [[Griphook]], [[Garrick Ollivander]], and [[Luna Lovegood]], the latter two of which had been held there for some time. In the end, all the prisoners escaped: Dean, Luna and Ollivander [[Apparition|Disapparating]] with [[Dobby]] the house-elf, while Harry and Ron went to save Hermione from Narcissa's sister, Bellatrix, who had used the [[Cruciatus Curse]] to brutally torture her. Later, in the brief duel that followed, Narcissa was shocked to see her family's former house-elf, Dobby, openly defying them. He was eventually murdered by Bellatrix as the group escaped the manor.<ref name="DH23" />

[[File:Narcissa 1998.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Narcissa is present and horrified when Voldemort murders goblins|alt=]]

After Harry and his friends escaped to [[Shell Cottage]], Lord Voldemort severely punished the Malfoy family, but did not act as harsh on Bellatrix.<ref name="DH24">{{DH|B|24}}</ref> By the time of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Narcissa had given her son, Draco, [[Narcissa Malfoy's wand|her wand]] to use in lieu of [[Draco Malfoy's wand|his own stolen wand]], leaving both herself and her husband without their original [[wand]]s, although the two later obtained second wands by the time of the battle.<ref name="DH31">{{DH|B|31}}</ref> She was also present when [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] [[Massacre at Malfoy Manor|interrogated and murdered]] [[goblin]]s in a fit of anger after learning of Harry Potter's [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]] break-in and theft of one of his Horcruxes.<ref name="DH27">{{DH|B|27}}</ref><ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref>

{{Dialogue a-b-a|Narcissa Malfoy|Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?|Harry Potter|Yes.|He is dead!|Narcissa lies about Harry being dead, thus betraying [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}} 
Towards the beginning of the battle, Draco lost his mother's wand in the [[Room of Requirement]], leaving it to be incinerated by [[Vincent Crabbe]]'s [[Fiendfyre]].<ref name="DH31" />

[[File:NarcissaCheckingIfHarryIsDead.png|250px|thumb|Narcissa checking if Harry is dead on Voldemort's orders|alt=]]

During the final phase of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] attempted to kill Harry Potter in the [[Forbidden Forest]] using the [[Killing Curse]]. Voldemort demanded that someone check to see if Harry was, in fact, dead, a deed no one wanted to perform. In the end, he forced Narcissa to check. Seeing that Harry was still alive, she used the opportunity to covertly ask Harry if he knew of Draco's well-being. In a whisper, she asked if [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] was alive. When Harry replied quietly that he was, Narcissa betrayed the Dark Lord and asserted that Harry was dead. After this, all the [[Death Eaters]] and people on Voldemort’s side laughed besides [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]] and Narcissa. Despite her family's allegiance to the Dark Lord, she knew the only way to reunite with Draco was as part of Voldemort's conquering army, thus proving she loved her family more than she supported Voldemort.<ref name="DH36">{{DH|B|36}}</ref> 

[[File:Voldemort vanquished.png|250px|thumb|left|Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort and the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]]|alt=]]

When the battle recommenced, Narcissa and Lucius abandoned the [[Death Eaters]] to look for Draco. The family was present for [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix's]] death at the hands of [[Molly Weasley]], and for Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort, thus ending the Second Wizarding War. After the battle, the family was reunited in the [[Great Hall]], where they seemed uncomfortable with their predicament, but did not leave.<ref name="DH36" />

===Later life===
Narcissa's betrayal allowed the entire Malfoy family to avoid incarceration in [[Azkaban]].<ref name="Online Chat" /> Narcissa would eventually become a grandmother to [[Scorpius Malfoy]], the son of Draco and his wife [[Astoria Malfoy|Astoria Greengrass]].

==Physical description==
{{Quote|His mother was blonde too; tall and slim, she would have been nice-looking if she hadn't been wearing a look that suggested there was a nasty smell under her nose.|Narcissa's appearance|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Narcissa Malfoy promo.jpg|200px|thumb|A middle aged Narcissa]]
Narcissa Malfoy was described to be the height of Harry Potter, slim, "nice-looking", and very pale, with blue eyes, long blonde hair, and a clear, cold voice. She had thin white fingers.<ref name="HBP6" /><ref name="hair" /><ref name="skin&hair" /><ref name="eyes" /><ref name="GOF8" /> Her hair colouring thus differed from most of the [[House of Black]], who generally had dark hair, though Narcissa did possess the arrogant good looks that were a common characteristic of her family. Despite her physical differences to her sisters, Bellatrix and Andromeda, [[Harry Potter]] did describe her as resembling Bellatrix somewhat, though Narcissa was as fair as Bellatrix was dark.

Narcissa's beauty was somewhat marred by her donning an expression that suggested that she was sniffing [[Faeces|dung]] whenever she was in the company of those she considered her inferiors.<ref name="GOF8" /> Harry Potter once insulted her son Draco by asking if she only had this expression when Draco was with her.<ref name="GOF13">{{GOF|B|13}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Now that I know the kind of scum that shops here...we'll do better at [[Twilfitt and Tattings|Twilfitt and Tatting's]].|Narcissa displaying prejudice|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Narcissa Malfoy DHF2 Promo.jpeg|220px|thumb|Narcissa during the [[Second Wizarding War]]|left]]
Narcissa was a very proud woman who frequently displayed a haughty and disdainful attitude, looking down upon others as she believed strongly in the importance of [[Blood status|blood purity]] and valued her family's wealth.<ref name="GOF8" /><ref name="HBP6" /> She was prejudiced towards [[Muggle-born]]s, other non-[[pure-blood]]s such as [[Fenrir Greyback]],<ref name="DH23" /> and so-called "[[blood traitor]]s".<ref name="HBP6" /> For example, she once rudely exclaimed to the owner of [[Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions|Madam Malkin's]] that she would rather shop at [[Twilfitt and Tattings]] instead since Madam Malkin's served "scum" such as [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]].<ref name="HBP6" /> Despite her beliefs and her family's close ties to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and the [[Death Eaters]], Narcissa never joined the organisation herself, nor received the [[Dark Mark]]. 

While she treated most people coldly,<ref name="HBP6" /> Narcissa was very loving towards her family as well as devoted to them.<ref name="HBP2" /> She was willing to do whatever it took to keep her son safe when he was put in danger during the [[Second Wizarding War]], from begging [[Severus Snape]] to take an [[Unbreakable Vow]] to help him<ref name="HBP2" /> to lying to Voldemort himself.<ref name="DH36" /> She cared deeply about her husband and son and displayed a fierce and protective temper on their behalf, as well as a ruthless determination to keep them safe.<ref name="HBP2" /><ref name="DH36" /> Her devotion to her son was such that she insisted on his attending Hogwarts instead of Durmstrang, despite the latter's reputation for blood purity amongst its students, solely for the sake of keeping him closer to home.<ref name="GOF11" />

Narcissa had a close relationship with her oldest sister [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] despite their differing temperaments and personality traits.<ref name="HBP2" /> Narcissa's alignment with their family's beliefs led her to ignore and disown "[[Blood traitor|blood traitors]]" such as her older sister [[Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]] and cousin [[Sirius Black]].<ref name="DH1" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Love]]''': Narcissa loved her [[Lucius Malfoy|husband]] and [[Draco Malfoy|son]] dearly, and was willing to do anything to protect them, such as by securing an [[Unbreakable Vow]] with [[Severus Snape]], to ensure that Draco had some form of protection.<ref name="HBP2" /> Narcissa's love also drove her to lie to [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] himself, which was instrumental both in locating Draco, and Voldemort's final defeat at the hands of [[Harry Potter]]. This also indirectly ensured Harry was protected again by a mother's love. During the [[Battle of Hogwarts|final battle]], she did not attempt to participate in the fight, but searched everywhere for her son along with her husband until they eventually found him.<ref name="DH36" />
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Narcissa was described as being a practising [[Dark wizard|Dark witch]] by her former [[house-elf]] [[Dobby]].<ref name="GOF21">{{GOF|B|21}}</ref> Her [[House of Black|Black family]] background and association with the Death Eaters also very strongly added to her connection with Dark magic.<ref name="OOTP6">{{OOTP|B|6}}</ref>
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Narcissa appeared to be a mistress of Apparition, perhaps even more skilled than Bellatrix. This was demonstrated when they both apparated into [[Spinner's End]], with Narcissa making only a slight "popping" sound and Bellatrix's pop being somewhat louder.<ref name="HBP2" /> With Apparition, it was generally considered that the quieter the 'pop', the more skilled at Apparition that [[Wizardkind|wizard or witch]] is, although Bellatrix may simply have been too desperate in chasing Narcissa to do it more quietly.
[[File:Skirmish malfoy manor.gif|250px|thumb|Narcissa and Draco duelling Harry and Ron at Malfoy Manor]]
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Though not as powerful as her [[Bellatrix Lestrange|prodigious sister]], Narcissa was a proficient duelist in her own right. She seemed confident in her ability to duel the likes of both [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] when they threatened to attack her son Draco in [[Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions|Madam Malkin's]],<ref name="HBP6" /> and she later duelled them during the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]] by firing various offensive [[spell]]s at them, managing to successfully stand her ground against them.<ref name="DH23" /> She was one of the very few who were unafraid to stand up to Bellatrix: she once used magic to repel her sister to such extent that Bellatrix, who was grasping Narcissa's arm, "let go of her sister's arm as though burned".<ref name="HBP2" />
*'''[[Occlumency]] (possibly)''': Though it was never confirmed, it was still implied that Narcissa was probably a skilful Occlumens, due to her ability to effectively lie to [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] himself, who was believed to be the most accomplished [[Legilimency|Legilimens]] of his time.<ref name="DH36" /> However, it is possible that Voldemort might not have been using Legilimency when Narcissa lied about [[Harry Potter|Harry]]'s death.

== Possessions==
[[File:Narcissa Malfoy wand.png|thumb|Narcissa's first wand]]

*'''[[Narcissa Malfoy's wand|First wand]]''': Narcissa owned a [[wand]], which was of an unknown length, [[wand wood]] and [[wand core]].<ref name="DH23" /> She gave her wand to her son [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] after his own [[Draco Malfoy's wand|wand]] was stolen by [[Harry Potter]] during the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]].<ref name="DH31" />
*'''Second wand''': Narcissa owned a second wand that she used during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], which was also of unknown specifics.<ref name="DHF2" />
*'''[[Narcissa Malfoy's spider earrings|Earrings]]''': By 1996, Narcissa owned and wore elegant earrings in the form of [[spider]]s.<ref name="HBPF">{{HBP|F}} - Chapter 4 (''Snape's Visitors'')</ref><ref name="DHF1">{{DH|F1}}</ref><ref name="DHF2" />

[[File:LuciusMalfoy.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Lucius Malfoy, her husband and father of her son]]
Narcissa and her husband, [[Lucius Malfoy]], were shown to have an affectionate and [[Love|loving]] relationship.<ref name="HBP2" /><ref name="DH1" /> He gave in to her wishes when she wanted their son to attend [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], rather than [[Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]].<ref name="GOF11" /> Lucius also allowed his wife to continue the Black Family naming custom of stars and constellations through their son, showing obvious respect for her family and deference to herself. Narcissa and Lucius both enjoyed being members of the social elite, and loved and spoiled their only child. Unlike Bellatrix, who did not hold love for her [[Rodolphus Lestrange (II)|husband]], Narcissa truly loved Lucius.<ref name="HBP2" />

Narcissa was very upset when he was briefly imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] and became defensive when others mentioned his failures.<ref name="HBP2" /> In [[1997]], when [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] took over their home and demanded that Lucius give him his wand, Lucius seemed fearful, and only when she touched his wrist did he turn it over.<ref name="DH1" />

====Draco Malfoy====

[[File:Draco Malfoy Promo HPB.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Draco Malfoy, her son]]
Narcissa adored her only child, [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]], and was very protective of him.<ref name="HBP2" /><ref name="HBP6" /><ref name="DH36" /> She insisted he not attend the [[Durmstrang Institute]] because it was so far from home,<ref name="GOF11" /> and frequently sent him sweet and [[cake]] packages during his first year at Hogwarts.<ref name="PS9" /><ref name="GOF13" />

{{Quote|That's because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store! Why, Severus? Why my son? It is too dangerous! This is vengeance for Lucius's mistake, I know it!|Narcissa's concern for her son|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
Narcissa was terrified to the point of hysteria when Draco was ordered by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] to kill [[Albus Dumbledore]]. Narcissa suspected that Voldemort meant him to fail as punishment for [[Lucius Malfoy|her husband]]'s failure in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]. To help him, Narcissa went to [[Severus Snape]] and begged for his assistance, whereupon she asked of him to make an [[Unbreakable Vow]], making him promise to protect Draco and take over his task if he failed.<ref name="HBP2" /> Later on in the [[Second Wizarding War|war]], she tried to shelter Draco as much as possible. During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Narcissa lied to the Dark Lord about [[Harry Potter]]'s death so she and Lucius would be able to search for Draco in the castle.<ref name="DH36" /> Draco, in turn, held his mother in great esteem, and became extremely angry if anyone insulted her.<ref name="GOF13" /><ref name="HBP6" />

====Astoria Greengrass====
Narcissa and her husband Lucius did not think highly of [[Astoria Malfoy|Astoria]], as she raised their grandson [[Scorpius Malfoy|Scorpius]] to have a more tolerant view on [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] (and likely Muggle-borns, half-bloods, Squibs or even non-human magical creatures).

Because of this, family gatherings were often fraught with tension. It is likely they see Astoria as a blood traitor because of this. Narcissa's relationship with Scorpius is unknown.

====Bellatrix Lestrange====
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Bellatrix Lestrange|Cissy — Narcissa — listen to me.|Narcissa Malfoy|Go back, Bella!|You must listen to me!|I've listened already. I've made my decision. Leave me alone!|Narcissa having a disagreement with her sister|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

[[File:Bellatrix Lestrange (née Black).jpg|200px|thumb|left|Bellatrix Lestrange, her elder sister]]
Narcissa appeared to have a fairly affectionate and close relationship with her older sister [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]]. The two fondly called each other by their nicknames of "Cissy" and "Bella". Bellatrix accompanied Narcissa to see Snape at [[Spinner's End]], in spite of her distrust for [[Severus Snape]] and belief that they should not discuss the task [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] assigned in secret.<ref name="HBP2" />

Narcissa was also one of the only people who was able to question Bellatrix's authority without unleashing Bellatrix's anger.<ref name="HBP2" /><ref name="DH23" /> The two sometimes clashed over Draco, as Narcissa was concerned about his welfare, while Bellatrix coldly stated her belief that he was doing his duty by serving Voldemort and that Narcissa should be proud.<ref name="HBP2" />

It is not known whether Narcissa knew about Bellatrix's daughter from Voldemort, but [[Delphini]] was born at Malfoy Manor. If Narcissa did know, then it is possible that she continued to keep this a secret for many years to come, to protect not only her niece but also her own family from any public backlash.

====Regulus Black====
Narcissa's relationship with her other late cousin, [[Regulus Black]], Sirius's younger brother, is unknown, though judging by Regulus's inclination towards the pure-blood supremacist ideals of the Blacks, which led him to follow [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and become one of his [[Death Eaters]], the same circle to which her husband belonged, it is likely that she and he had a good relationship and maintained contact, or at least held him in higher esteem than [[Sirius Black|Sirius]], who earned his family's repudiation for his rejection of their ideals. It is unknown whether she knew of her cousin's betrayal to the Dark Lord in an attempt to keep the life of his house-elf [[Kreacher]] safe. The confidences Kreacher had with her and Bellatrix could also be an indicator of the good relationship she may have had with Regulus.

====Andromeda Tonks and Sirius Black====
Narcissa did not hold her late cousin [[Sirius Black]] or her older sister [[Andromeda Tonks]] in high regard, presumably because they were both "[[blood traitor]]s" who were disowned by the [[House of Black|Black family]]. Bellatrix claimed that she and Narcissa had not seen Andromeda since she married [[Muggle-born]] wizard [[Edward Tonks|Ted Tonks]], which would have occurred in the early [[1970s]].<ref name="DH1" /> Narcissa also mercilessly threw Sirius's death in [[Harry Potter]]'s face when he taunted her about Lucius's imprisonment in [[1996]].<ref name="HBP6" /> For his part, Sirius held his cousin in contempt for her prejudiced beliefs.<ref name="OOTP6" /> Since Narcissa broke all ties with her sister Andromeda, she most likely didn't care either for her niece [[Nymphadora Tonks]] and didn't consider her to be a part of the family.

=== Harry Potter and his friends===
{{Dialogue a-b-c-a|Narcissa Malfoy|I see that being [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's]] favourite has given you a false sense of security, Harry Potter. But Dumbledore won't always be there to protect you.|Harry Potter|Wow... look at that... he's not here now! So why not have a go? They might find you a double cell in [[Azkaban]] with your loser of a [[Lucius Malfoy|husband]]!|Draco Malfoy|Don't you dare talk to my mother like that, Potter!|It's all right, Draco. I expect Potter will be reunited with dear [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] before I am reunited with [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]].|[[Harry Potter]], Narcissa Malfoy and [[Draco Malfoy]] arguing in [[Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions]].|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

[[File:Harry Potter DHF1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Harry Potter]], whom she saved from Lord Voldemort]]
Harry held Narcissa in contempt due to his rivalry with her son and hatred of her husband.<ref name="GOF13" /><ref name="HBP6" /> In the same respect, Narcissa held Harry and his friends in disdain and contempt, especially [[Hermione Granger]], as she was [[Muggle-born]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], as he was a [[blood traitor]]. Narcissa also held Harry in contempt for being Dumbledore's favourite student and associating with those whom she considered to be inferior.<ref name="HBP6" />

When [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] "killed" Harry in the Forbidden Forest, she asked him whether [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] was still alive, as she knew that the only way she and Lucius could search for Draco inside Hogwarts would be as part of Voldemort's victorious army. Though she disliked Harry, she placed her family's welfare over Voldemort's goals. On confirming Draco's very much alive status, she plainly lied that Harry Potter was "dead". This action of hers was instrumental, not only in Harry's survival but in Voldemort's final defeat as well; thus, Harry's survival was once again ensured by a mother's love, although indirectly.<ref name="DH36" />

===Severus Snape===
[[File:Severus Snape OOTP.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Severus Snape]]]] 
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b-a-b|Narcissa Malfoy|Will you, Severus, watch over my son, Draco, as he attempts to fulfil the Dark Lord's wishes?|Severus Snape|I will.|And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?|I will.|And, should it prove necessary... if it seems Draco will fail... will you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?|I will.|Narcissa making an [[Unbreakable Vow]] with Snape|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
Like [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]], Narcissa held [[Severus Snape]] in high esteem and trusted him due to him being an old friend of [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]]'s since their time at Hogwarts. Unlike her son, she continued to invest her faith in him despite Lucius's imprisonment and her older sister [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]]'s doubts about him. When Draco was made a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] and ordered to kill [[Albus Dumbledore]], Narcissa saw this as a suicide mission and went to Snape for help. Snape, who likewise understood Draco was being set up to fail, agreed to her request to watch over Draco, and take over if it seemed he would fail.<ref name="HBP2" /> It is unknown how she reacted when it was revealed that Snape was a double agent.

=== Kreacher ===
[[File:Kreacher OotP SF.png|200px|thumb|right|[[Kreacher]]]]
Like most of the [[House of Black|Blacks]] except [[Sirius Black|Sirius]], Narcissa was held in high esteem by [[Kreacher]], the Black family house-elf. She in turn treated the attention-starved house-elf more kindly than her cousin did. This enabled her to learn about [[Harry Potter|Harry]]'s love for Sirius Black. Thus she was able to provide intel to [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] that led to the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.<ref name="OOTP37" /> That battle caused many tragedies for Harry and the Malfoys: it led to the death of Sirius Black and Lucius's imprisonment and further loss of favour, which in turn led to Voldemort making Draco a Death Eater. It is unknown how Narcissa reacted to Kreacher accepting Harry as his master, if she ever learned of it, but she was may have been sympathetic due to the fact she and her family, like her cousin [[Regulus Black]], regretted being loyal to Voldemort.

==Etymology==
Unlike many others of the [[House of Black]], Narcissa does not appear to be named after a star or constellation.

*The name ''Narcissa'' is derived from {{W|Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus}}, a beautiful but vain character in Greek mythology from which the term ''{{W|Narcissism|narcissism}}'', which refers to vanity and elitism, is derived. The name can also be derived from the flower by the same name, also known as {{W|Daffodil|daffodil}}. The name of the plant may also be derived from the Greek word ''narkoa'', "to numb", referring to its narcotic properties. There is also a Slytherin connection to Narcissa's name due to its association with the Narcisse snake pits.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190606152058/http://www.amusingplanet.com/2014/01/narcisse-snake-pits-in-manitoba-canada.html Narcisse Snake Pits in Manitoba, Canada]</ref>
*''Malfoy'' is derived from the French ''mal foi'' or ''mal foy'', meaning ''bad faith'' or ''unfaithful''.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:LEGO Narcissa.jpg|144px|thumb|Narcissa as a LEGO minifigure]]

*It was rumoured that the English actress {{W|Naomi Watts}} would portray Narcissa in {{HBP|FA}}. However, this was refuted by Watts's representatives. Before her death in 2009, Natasha Richardson was considered for the role as well as Jennifer Saunders and Irish actress {{W|Alison Doody}}. Finally, in November 2007, it was announced that the late [[Helen McCrory]], who was originally cast as Bellatrix Lestrange in {{OOTP|FA}}, was cast as Narcissa Malfoy.
*[[J. K. Rowling]] stated that Narcissa Malfoy was not a Death Eater, but merely agreed with the philosophy of blood purity.
**This is perhaps why, in {{LEGO|Y2}}, Narcissa is a character without the ability to perform Dark magic.
*Despite not being a full Death Eater, she is shown taking orders from [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. She may also have joined her husband and other Death Eaters in humiliating Muggles at the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]]. She also assisted Voldemort in luring Harry Potter into a trap using [[Kreacher]]'s information.
*In the book version of {{HBP}}, it is Narcissa who asks [[Severus Snape]] to make the [[Unbreakable Vow]]. In the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|film version]] it is her sister [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] who suggests the Vow.

[[File:Pottermore Narcissa.png|thumb|right|Narcissa Malfoy on {{PM}}]]

*Also, in the book version of {{HBP}}, Narcissa has blonde hair. In the first promotional pictures of Helen on set, Narcissa has long blonde hair as well; but in later pictures, and in the film versions of ''Half Blood Prince'', she appears to have brown hair on top and blonde on the bottom. However, in both instalments of ''Deathly Hallows'', she appears to have mainly black hair with more visibly seen blonde/white streaks. This can be seen as a combination of the Malfoy family's blonde hair and the Black family's dark hair. This change in hair colour could also be seen to represent her growing disillusionment with both Voldemort as well as the Malfoy and Black families' traditional beliefs.[[File:Narcissa Malfoy concept art by Andrew Williamson.jpg|thumb|Concept art of Narcissa Malfoy illustrated by [[Andrew Williamson]]]]
*In the book version of {{DH}}, Narcissa and Lucius ran through the Battle of Hogwarts when the fighting began again, screaming for their son. They appeared in the Great Hall at the end of the Battle, though appearing unsure if they should be there. In the film, Narcissa grasped her son's hand and began to retreat across the bridge, not looking behind her and walking as fast as possible. Lucius ran after them a few moments later.
*When interviewed, Helen McCrory said that she had to film four different ending scenes in {{DH|F2}}. However, Tom Felton, the actor who portrays Draco, later said they were more like minor alterations.<ref>[https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a316786/tom-felton-no-multiple-harry-potter-endings/ Tom Felton: 'No multiple Harry Potter endings' on Digital Spy]</ref>
*In the film version of the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]], Dobby [[Disarming Charm|disarmed]] Narcissa by snapping his fingers.
**Although Dobby disarmed Narcissa, he conveniently dropped the wand before he Disapparates from Malfoy Manor, allowing Narcissa to recover it.
*In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Deathly Hallows: Part 2]]'', Narcissa is seen holding another wand. This wand is the subject of a continuity error. Originally, Narcissa was to retrieve [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]]'s wand from [[Harry Potter]] when she checks him for signs of life in the [[Forbidden Forest]]. After Draco rejoins his family during the temporary ceasefire, his mother returns the wand to him. An alternate scene was to show Draco throwing Harry the wand when Harry leaps from [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s arms, but this was not shown in the final cut of the film. Harry was shown to still have his wand after being carried back to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] by Hagrid. As such, the wand remains a continuity error, as both Harry, Narcissa and Draco are seen holding it in the same scene.
*In the books, Narcissa seems to be somewhat more emotional than her film counterpart; she is noticeably hysterical and distraught when begging Snape to make the Unbreakable Vow in the book, whereas in the film, she is much more composed and only seems slightly teary.
*In a deleted (and unreleased scene) from the ''Deathly Hallows Part 1'', as Snape arrives at Malfoy Manor, Voldemort informs him that Narcissa has been 'most hospitable', to which Narcissa replies 'My Lord is always welcome here'. This is the only known full line that Narcissa has in the script.
*In {{HM}}, one of the many event exclusive outfits was based on Narcissa's outfit and hairstyle.<ref>{{HM}}, "Full Marks" event (see [https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Filnozxr2mgb41.jpg%3Fwidth%3D960%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D9e180500ec77ea802cc19e34358bd7899fafd44b this image])</ref>
