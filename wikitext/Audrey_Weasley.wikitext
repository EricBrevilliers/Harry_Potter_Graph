'''Audrey Weasley''' (maiden name unknown) was the wife of [[Percy Weasley]]. The couple had two daughters, [[Molly Weasley (II)|Molly]] and [[Lucy Weasley|Lucy]].<ref name=WFT>[https://archive.ph/qJjm4#selection-1403.0-1403.57 Times Online - The Unwritten Story of Harry's Friends and Their Children] (Archived)</ref> It is possible that one or both of their daughters were attending or starting at Hogwarts in [[2017]], due to the fact that her [[Percy Weasley|husband]] Percy was at [[King's Cross Station]] on [[1 September]] that year.<ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref>

While it is unknown as to whether or not she worked at the Ministry, Audrey knew all their rules and regulations in detail, thanks to her husband.<ref name="Tree">[http://web.archive.org/web/20180315000306/https://www.pottermore.com/about/the-weasley-family-tree-text-version The Weasley family tree]</ref>

==Etymology==
The name Audrey is of Old English origin, and the meaning of Audrey is "noble strength". Also the root, via Saint Audrey, for the word "tawdry", due to lace and goods sold at Saint Audrey's Fair in England. Saint Audrey was a sixth-century English princess also known as Etheldreda. Literary: Shakespeare used the name for Touchstone's comic sweetheart in "As You Like It".
