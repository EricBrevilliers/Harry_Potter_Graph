==Biography==
On [[23 June]] [[1991]], [[Vernon Dursley]] considered her as a replacement babysitter for [[Harry Potter]] when [[Arabella Figg]] broke her leg. Unfortunately for the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]], she was on holiday in [[Majorca]] at the time (which Petunia bluntly reminded Vernon of), and they were forced to take Harry to the [[zoo]] on [[Dudley Dursley]]'s [[Dudley Dursley's eleventh birthday|eleventh birthday]].<ref name="PS2">{{PS|B|2}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In cut content from {{PS|FA}}, when [[Vernon Dursley|Vernon]] and [[Petunia Dursley]] discuss whom to leave [[Harry Potter]] with, as [[Arabella Figg]] broke her leg, when Vernon suggests leaving him with Yvonne, Petunia tells him to not be silly, as she hates Harry. This is unlike [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|the book]], in which Yvonne can't take Harry because she is on holiday in [[Majorca]] (with no confirmation of her dislike of Harry) and it was instead Vernon's sister [[Marjorie Dursley|Marge]] whom Vernon proposed to leave Harry with only for Petunia to remark that she hates Harry.
