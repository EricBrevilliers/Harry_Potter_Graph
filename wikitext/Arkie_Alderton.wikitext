==Biography==
On [[2 September]] [[1997]], [[Arkie Alderton's alleged son|one]] of the alleged [[Muggle-born]]s rounded up for the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]] claimed that he was a [[half-blood]] by claiming to be Alderton's son, but he was not believed.<ref name="DH13"/>

==Etymology==
Arkie can be a diminutive short form of several names. In the cases of Greek names like Archimedes and Arcadius it is most often an altered form of the Greek name element αρχι ''archi'' (master). In the case of Germanic names like Archibald it is ultimately derived from the element ''ercan'' (pure, holy, genuine, precious), which entered Middle English as ''arc'' from the Old French borrowing ''arch'', its adaptation having been influenced by the aforementioned Greek-derived element.

{{W|Alderton (surname)|Alderton}} is an [[England|English]] habitational surname from "[[alder]]" and the town-name ending "-ton", likely a reflex of Old English ''Alortūn''.
