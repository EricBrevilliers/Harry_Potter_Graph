"Odo" is a name typically associated with {{W|Odo|historical figures}} from the Middle Ages and before, most especially {{W|Odo of France}}, who led a successful defence of Paris against the Vikings in 885. Odo, and its later form [[Otto (disambiguation)|Otto]], are etymologically related to various European names which all come from a Germanic word meaning "possessor of wealth".
