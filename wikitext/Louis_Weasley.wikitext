'''Louis Weasley''' was the youngest child and only son of [[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur Weasley]] {{c|née [[Delacour family|Delacour]]}}. He had two elder sisters, [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]] and [[Dominique Weasley]].<ref name="WFT">[https://archive.ph/qJjm4#selection-1403.0-1403.57 Times Online - The Unwritten Story of Harry's Friends and Their Children] (Archived)</ref> It is most likely that he lived at [[Shell Cottage]] with his family.

==Etymology==
The name "Louis" is the French form of Ludovicus, the Latinised form of Ludwig. From Old German ''hlod'' and ''wig'', meaning "fame" and "warrior". The king Clovis I (5th century) was the first Christian king in France. This was the name of eighteen kings of France, starting with Louis I, the son of Charlemagne (8th century), and including Louis IX (Saint Louis), who led two crusades, and Louis XIV (the 'Sun King'), who was the ruler of France during the height of its power, the builder of the Palace of Versailles, and the longest reigning monarch in the history of Europe.

==Behind the scenes==
*Louis is the only confirmed male in [[canon]] with [[Veela]] blood. [[Cassandra Vole's father]] may possibly be another example.
*[[J. K. Rowling]]'s great-grandfather was also named Louis. It is unknown whether Louis Weasley is named in honour of him.
