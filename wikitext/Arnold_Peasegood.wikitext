==Etymology==
The name "Arnold" comes from a Germanic name meaning "eagle power", derived from the elements arn "eagle" and wald "power". It was brought by the Normans to England, where it replaced the Old English cognate Earnweald. It died out as an English name after the Middle Ages, but it was revived in the 19th century.
