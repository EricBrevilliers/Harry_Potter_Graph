'''Minister Cornelius Oswald Fudge''', {{OM|First}}, was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who served as the thirty-second [[Minister for Magic]] of the [[British Ministry of Magic]], in office from [[1990]] to [[1996]].<ref name="HPcom-ministers">{{HPcom|ministers-for-magic}}</ref> Although reliant on the advice of [[Albus Dumbledore]] at first, by the height of his power, he had complete control of the Ministry of Magic,<ref name="OOTP4">{{OOTP|B|4}}</ref> as well as extensive influence over the publishing of the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''.<ref name="OOTP5">{{OOTP|B|5}}</ref>

Fudge began his career in the Ministry as Junior Minister in the [[Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes]].<ref name="POA10">{{POA|B|10}}</ref> He was chosen to succeed [[Millicent Bagnold]] as Minister for Magic,<ref name="HPcom-ministers"/> after [[Albus Dumbledore]] declined the position and [[Bartemius Crouch Senior]] was refused it on the account of his poor popularity.<ref name="GOF27">{{GOF|B|27}}</ref> He thus had the responsibility of meeting with the [[Prime Minister|Muggle Prime Minister]] when necessary, which became increasingly frequent with the advent of the [[Second Wizarding War]].<ref name="HBP1">{{HBP|B|1}}</ref>

Fudge's tenure saw a marked increase in [[pure-blood supremacy]] both within the Ministry of Magic and throughout the larger British wizarding community, all directing towards the eventual [[Return of Lord Voldemort]] in [[1995]].<ref name="GOF33">{{GOF|B|3}}</ref> When [[Ginevra Weasley]] was possessed by [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|Tom Riddle's Diary]] to commit attacks on [[Muggle-born]] students at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], Fudge was involved in [[Order of Suspension|suspending]] Dumbledore and incarcerating [[Rubeus Hagrid]], the suspected attacker.<ref name="COS14">{{COS|B|14}}</ref> Later, he was forced to deal with the escape of the assumed [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] and mass-murderer [[Sirius Black]], who was also innocent.<ref name="POA3">{{POA|B|3}}</ref> Although Fudge and the Ministry came close to apprehending Black, Black ultimately [[Rescue of Sirius Black and Buckbeak|escaped]] from Fudge's fingers.<ref name="POA21">{{POA|B|21}}</ref>

Death Eater activity heightened after the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup|422nd Quidditch World Cup]], hosted in [[Great Britain]], where the celebrations were followed by a Death Eater terrorist attack and where the [[Dark Mark]] illuminated the skies for the first time in thirteen years.<ref name="GOF9">{{GOF|B|9}}</ref> This activity only heightened during the subsequent [[Triwizard Tournament]], but Fudge refused to believe [[Harry Potter]]'s claim that [[Cedric Diggory]]'s had been murdered at the hands of Lord Voldemort.<ref name="OOTP1">{{OOTP|B|1}}</ref> Fudge leveraged the ''Daily Prophet'' to silence Potter,<ref name="OOTP5"/> fired Ministry staff who supported Dumbledore,<ref name="OOTP4"/> and grew increasingly paranoid that Dumbledore was attempting to overthrow him.<ref name="OOTP5"/><ref name="OOTP27">{{OOTP|B|27}}</ref>

However, following the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], Fudge saw Voldemort with his own eyes and was forced to admit that Harry and Dumbledore had been telling the truth the whole time, causing the wizarding community to protest and scream for his resignation. He made several desperate attempts to retain his position but was eventually sacked from it in complete disgrace. He was replaced as Minister for Magic by [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] but stayed in an [[Advisor to the Minister for Magic|advisory]] capacity and communicated news of the [[Second Wizarding War]] to the Muggle Prime Minister if Scrimgeour was unable to.<ref name="HBP1"/>

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Cornelius Oswald Fudge was born before [[1964]]<ref name="DOB"/> in presumably [[Great Britain]] to either a [[half-blood]] or [[pure-blood]] family.<ref name="BLOOD"/> During his childhood and teenage years, Fudge attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="opf29">{{POA|F}}, Chapter 29 (''Onlookers to the rescue'') - Dumbledore comments "''You remember this footpath, Minister, from your school days here?''"</ref> It is unknown what [[Hogwarts Houses|house]] he was [[Sorting Ceremony|sorted]] into.

===Early career at the Ministry {{C|1981–1990}}===
By [[1981]], Fudge was the [[junior minister]] in the [[Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes]]. After the [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1981)|attack]] at [[Godric's Hollow]], he was one of the first on the scene after [[Sirius Black]] seemed to kill [[Peter Pettigrew]], but, unknown by anybody else, Black had been framed by Pettigrew himself. Fudge watched Sirius laughing maniacally, and twelve years later, he still remembered the giant crater in the street.<ref name="POA10">{{POA|B|10}}</ref>

[[Albus Dumbledore]] was the top candidate to succeed [[Millicent Bagnold]] as the next [[Minister for Magic]], as many people requested him to accept the position, but he refused multiple times. Therefore, [[Bartemius Crouch Senior]] was favoured to be the next Minister for his effective methods of fighting the [[Death Eaters]], but it was Fudge who finally replaced Bagnold when Crouch lost popularity following his [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|son]]'s trial. However, Fudge never forgot how much popularity and support Dumbledore received during the election. He also never forgot how much Crouch was admired in the Ministry, leaving him so jealous and with a strong dislike of Crouch that his very first act as Minister of Magic was to have Crouch reassigned to the Department of International Magical Cooperation.

===Minister for Magic {{C|1990–1996}}===
====Early career====
{{Quote|A Fair Deal for Wizards Who Deal Fair with Muggles.|Cornelius Fudge's campaign slogan|The Daily Prophet (real-world)}}
[[File:Jacob's sibling speaking with Cornelius Fudge HM715.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Fudge speaking to Jacob's sibling]]
In late [[1990]], Fudge was appointed [[Minister for Magic]]. In his first days as the Minister, he asked for an urgent report on [[magical transportation]], which was completed by [[Alastor Moody]] based on [[Jacob's sibling]]'s research.<ref name="HM710A">{{HM|7|10|Transportation Regulation}}</ref> He then talked to Jacob's sibling in person and informed them of the upcoming [[Trial of Kazuhiro Shiratori|trial]] of the [[Kazuhiro Shiratori|white-robed wizard]]. Shortly afterwards,<ref name="HM715">{{HM|7|15}}</ref> he had his first meeting with the [[Prime Minister's predecessor|Muggle Prime Minister]] to introduce himself and to explain the existence of the [[wizarding world]]. Fudge cheerily hoped that the pair would never need to meet again due to the Prime Minister trying to throw Fudge out of his office window, as he believed their meeting was an attempt at the hands of the [[opposition]] to sabotage his career and position in the Muggle world.<ref name="HBP1"/>

It was said that he was not very self-confident in his early days and constantly sent [[Cornelius Fudge's daily letters to Albus Dumbledore|letters]] to [[Albus Dumbledore]], asking for advice.<ref name="PS5">{{PS|B|5}}</ref>

According to the magazine ''[[The Quibbler]]'', Fudge desired to conquer [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]], and in order to do so, he allegedly had [[goblin]]s killed in ludicrous ways such as drowning them, dropping them off buildings, [[poison]]ing them, and cooking them in pies, earning him the epithet "Goblin-Crusher".<ref name="OOTP10">{{OOTP|B|10}}</ref> However, as ''The Quibbler'' was a tabloid magazine, this theory was extremely debatable and almost certainly false. Similarly, according to [[Luna Lovegood]], daughter of the [[Xenophilius Lovegood|editor]] of ''The Quibbler'', Cornelius had a private army of [[Heliopath]]s, [[spirit]]s of [[fire]] whose existence was doubted by almost everyone else.<ref name="OOTP16">{{OOTP|B|16}}</ref>

At some point early on during his Ministerial career and before [[1995]],<ref name="OP19">{{OOTP|B|19}}</ref> Fudge arrogantly and controversially awarded himself the [[Order of Merlin]], First Class award.<ref name="PMordermerlin">{{HPcom|order-of-merlin}}</ref> This caused a good deal of muttering among the wizarding community since the common view was that his career was "''less than distinguished''", thus subverting the worth of this award (which was given out "''for acts of outstanding bravery or distinction''").<ref name="PMordermerlin"/>

====The Chamber of Secrets====
{{Quote|Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad business. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things’ve gone far enough. Ministry’s got to act.|Cornelius to Rubeus Hagrid|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Harry-potter2-fudge in hut.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Cornelius Fudge with [[Lucius Malfoy]] and Albus Dumbledore during Rubeus Hagrid's arrest]]
After four attacks on [[Muggle-born]] witches and wizards, Fudge arrived at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in the spring of [[1993]] to bring [[Rubeus Hagrid]] to [[Azkaban]] prison, mainly because Hagrid's record was against him. Dumbledore tried to convince Fudge that taking Hagrid would make no difference, but Fudge was quick to cite that out of dutiful obligation he had no other choice. However, Fudge had his doubts and reassured Hagrid that if another person was found to be responsible, he would be released immediately. At the same time, Lucius Malfoy, a then school governor, had Dumbledore suspended, which Fudge tried to protest against but in futility.<ref name="COS14"/> Eventually, when it was proven that Hagrid was indeed innocent, Fudge was as good as his word and immediately released him.<ref name="COS18">{{COS|B|18}}</ref>

That summer, [[Sirius Black]] escaped from Azkaban. A few weeks prior to Black's escape, Fudge had visited him while on a tour of Azkaban prison and was unnerved at how normal Black seemed relative to the other prisoners.<ref name="POA10"/>

Convinced Black would be caught quickly, Fudge alerted the [[British Prime Minister in 1996|Muggle Prime Minister]] of the situation<ref name="HBP1"/> and asked that the Muggles keep an eye out for Black, as well; the Ministry set up a special hot line for the Muggles to call with any information.<ref name="POA2">{{POA|B|2}}</ref> Because of Black's connection to [[Harry Potter]], Fudge was reluctant to inform Harry of the truth, something to which [[Arthur Weasley]] voiced his opposing opinion.<ref name="POA4">{{POA|B|4}}</ref>

====Targeting Sirius Black and rescuing Marjorie Dursley====
{{Quote|Well, Harry, you’ve had us all in a right flap, I don’t mind telling you. Running away from your aunt and uncle’s house like that! I’d started to think… but you’re safe, and that’s what matters. Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then… You will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of Miss Marjorie Dursley. Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Department were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss Dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified. She has no recollection of the incident at all. So that’s that, and no harm done.|Fudge regarding an incident that took place earlier that evening|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Harry-potter4-movie-screencaps.com-1579.jpg|250px|thumb|Cornelius Fudge at the Leaky Cauldron speaking with Harry Potter]]
When Harry left the Dursleys' after blowing up Dudley's Aunt Marge, Fudge intercepted him outside the Leaky Cauldron after disembarking from the [[Knight Bus]] during his misguided attempt to go on the run. Fudge assured Harry that the problem had been dealt with; Marge had been punctured by members of the Accidental Magical Reversal Squad and her memory modified by Obliviators. When Harry asked what would happen to him, Fudge told him not to worry and that he would not receive punishment since the circumstances had changed.

The truth was, Fudge had let Harry off because he had been relieved to find him alive and told him that running away at night while a killer was on the loose was very irresponsible. Fudge then asked that for his protection, Harry stay at the [[Leaky Cauldron]] for what remained of the summer and not to venture back into Muggle London. Harry agreed and then asked Fudge if he would consider signing his [[Hogsmeade]] permission slip, to which Fudge uncomfortably declined, as he was not a parent or a guardian. Fudge then bid Harry goodbye, and he left the room.<ref name="POA3">{{POA|B|3}}</ref>
[[File:Rosmerta, Fudge and McGonagall.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|250px|Fudge and McGonagall informing [[Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]] about Harry Potter's relation with Sirius Black]]
As a misguided attempt to protect the students, Fudge posted [[Dementor]]s around the school,<ref name="POA5">{{POA|B|5}}</ref> which nearly produced tragic results. The teachers, as well as Madam Rosmerta in [[Hogsmeade]], found the creatures' presence distracting and highly unpleasant, and due to his tragic past, Harry was a frequent target of the Dementors' actions.<ref name="POA10"/>

In October, Fudge was alerted to Black's entry into Hogwarts on Hallowe'en night. Convinced Black was hiding either in or around Hogsmeade, Fudge had the Dementors search the area, calling it a necessary precaution. In December, he journeyed to the school, and stopped at the Three Broomsticks with Professors [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]], [[Filius Flitwick|Flitwick]], and [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]. Inviting Rosmerta to join them, Fudge proceeded to explain Black's connection to Harry Potter and that all evidence pointed out that Black told Voldemort where the Potters were hidden almost a week after he was appointed their [[Secret Keeper|Secret-Keeper]]. Fudge then admitted that he believed Black's eventual plan was to find Voldemort and return him to power. After this, Fudge left the pub for a meeting with Dumbledore. Unbeknownst to him, Harry Potter overheard this conversation and was greatly affected by it, hoping for the opportunity to kill Black.<ref name="POA10"/>

====The Buckbeak case====
[[File:Harry-potter4-movie-buckbeak execution.jpg|250px|thumb|Fudge and others arriving to witness Buckbeak's execution]]
In June, Fudge arrived at Hogwarts again, this time for two reasons: first, to check on the Black situation, and second, to witness the execution of [[Buckbeak]] the Hippogriff. At two o'clock, Fudge attended Buckbeak's appeal, but the [[Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures]] did not reverse its decision. At five that evening, Fudge returned to Hagrid's cabin to witness the execution, but when [[Walden Macnair|Macnair]] stepped outside to perform the act, he noticed that Buckbeak had disappeared.

When [[Severus Snape]] returned Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Black to the school after the [[Encounter at the Shrieking Shack|events in the Shrieking Shack]], Fudge informed him that for his actions, Fudge would try to wangle an Order of Merlin, Second or First Class for him. Moments later, Fudge entered the hospital wing after hearing Harry's shouts; Harry and Hermione attempted to convince Fudge that [[Peter Pettigrew]] was still alive, to no avail. Several minutes later, when Professor Dumbledore arrived to speak privately with Harry and Hermione, Fudge decided to meet the Dementors and rendezvous with Dumbledore later. While talking to Snape soon after, he said he suspected that once Harry was back in his right mind, he would want to tell the Prophet exactly how Snape saved him.

When they learned Black had escaped again, Fudge returned with Snape and Dumbledore to the hospital wing, where Snape furiously ordered Harry to explain his involvement. However, Fudge seemed to think Harry being involved was impossible and left to inform the Ministry about the situation but not before agreeing to remove the Dementors from the grounds due to their attempt to use the Dementor's Kiss on Harry the previous night.

====Quidditch World Cup====
During the summer holiday, Fudge had two tasks to organise with help from [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] and [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Bartemius Crouch]]: the final of the [[Quidditch World Cup]] and the [[Triwizard Tournament]].<ref name="GOF8"/>

Fudge met again with the Muggle Prime Minister to inform him of the magical creatures he was bringing into the country for the Tournament.<ref name="HBP1"/>

[[File:Harry-potter-goblet-of-fire-fudge.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Fudge introducing the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]]]]
At the World Cup, Fudge greeted Harry in a fatherly fashion and introduced him to several foreign wizards, including the [[Oblansk|Bulgarian Minister for Magic]]. Fudge also extended friendly greetings to the [[Malfoy family]].<ref name="GOF8">{{GOF|B|8}}</ref>

After the match ended, Fudge was irritated to learn that the Bulgarian Minister could speak English and that his own need to communicate through sign language had not been necessary. Along with the Bulgarian Minister, Fudge then shook hands with the two teams.<ref name="GOF8"/>

====Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter====
{{Quote|Harry couldn't believe what he was hearing. He had always thought of Fudge as a kindly figure, a little blustering, a little pompous, but essentially good-natured. But now a short, angry wizard stood before him refusing, point-blank, to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world — to believe that Voldemort could have risen.|Harry's incredulity at Fudge's denial of Voldemort's return|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
In the spring of 1995, Fudge was summoned to Hogwarts after Barty Crouch was seen going mad and then disappeared. Fudge decided to cover up this embarrassing situation, and also refused to believe anything Crouch said, believing it to be the words of a lunatic. Fudge even suggested that [[Olympe Maxime]] had murdered him due to her being a [[half-giant]] since the incident occurred near the [[Beauxbatons Carriage]] that night. When Dumbledore expressed his belief that Fudge's accusation was due to his personal prejudice towards so-called '[[half-breed]]s,' Fudge, in turn, believed that Dumbledore's friendship with [[Rubeus Hagrid]], another half-giant, was clouding his judgement. Harry also pointed out that Madame Maxime would have had a difficult time hiding due to her abnormal size, which left Fudge feeling embarrassed.<ref name="GOF28">{{GOF|B|28}}</ref> Fudge was later asked to fill in for Mr Crouch as a judge of the 1994 [[Triwizard Tournament]] since his assistant, [[Percy Weasley]], was hauled in for questioning regarding the incident and was unable to attend.

[[File:Third task aftermath.jpg|250px|thumb|Fudge with Harry Potter and [[Albus Dumbledore]], after a weakened Harry returned from the Little Hangleton graveyard]]
When Harry exited the Triwizard maze holding [[Cedric Diggory]]'s dead body, Fudge informed the crowd and then tried to get Harry to release him. After an injured Harry released Cedric's corpse, Fudge suggested that he go to the hospital wing. Dumbledore refused the suggestion, wanting Harry to remain where he was. When Fudge was informed the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] responsible had been caught, and feeling his personal safety was in jeopardy, he summoned a Dementor to accompany him into the castle, disregarding both Dumbledore's obvious dislike for the creatures and the fact that the culprit was already restrained; said Dementor then sucked out [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr's]] soul, leaving him an empty shell of his former self and unable to give testimony about Voldemort's return. This lack of testimony helped Fudge discredit both Harry and Dumbledore the following year.<ref name="OOTP">{{OOTP}}</ref>

[[File:B4C36M1 Snape Dark Mark reveal.png|250px|thumb|left|Snape using his Dark Mark as proof that Voldemort had returned]]
Paranoid that Dumbledore may have had designs on the role of Minister himself, Fudge refused to believe the warning that Voldemort had returned. Fudge's decision was also partially influenced by one of [[Rita Skeeter]]'s articles about Harry. In the article Skeeter wrote that Harry's scar had long-term negative effects on his mental health. This led Fudge to suggest that Harry may have been hallucinating. This made Harry an unreliable witness in Fudge's mind; when Harry started naming the identities of the Death Eaters who returned to Voldemort's side, he could only identify those who had been cleared by the Wizengamot, which Fudge claimed Harry could have looked up in old copies of the ''Daily Prophet'', and took it as a great offence.

Dumbledore, however, insisted that the situation was still salvageable if they took the necessary precautions; they needed to remove Azkaban from the control of the Dementors and send peace envoys to the giants. Fudge was horrified at the mere prospect of both of these, stating it would mean the end of his career if he did either one. Dumbledore, in turn, countered that Fudge was blinded by the love of his office and his own prejudices. He provided a warning that the decision Fudge made here and now would affect how he was remembered in the future: if Fudge took the necessary measures, he would be hailed as a hero throughout the ages, whether he remained in office or not. If he did nothing, then he would be immortalised as a coward who allowed Voldemort the opportunity to try and destroy the world they tried so hard to rebuild.

However, Fudge saw Dumbledore's suggestions as ludicrous (fearing he would be forced out of office for even suggesting it). As such, he and Dumbledore acknowledged that they had reached a parting of the ways; Fudge was left to act as he saw fit, while Dumbledore acted immediately to reactivate the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. Even a screaming argument with [[Minerva McGonagall]] and seeing [[Severus Snape]]'s reactivated [[Dark Mark]] branding did not convince Fudge in the very least; if anything, he was increasingly angry at Minerva and revolted at Severus. Before leaving the school, Fudge was courteous enough to hand Harry his winnings for the Tournament, though he cancelled the award ceremony due to the circumstances.<ref name="GOF36">{{GOF|B|36}}</ref>

[[File:Fudge Press.jpg|250px|thumb|Fudge's [[Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter|campaign designed to slander and discredit]] both Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore]]
Over the summer, Fudge used his influence at the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' to create a [[Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter|campaign]] designed to slander and discredit both [[Albus Dumbledore]], who Fudge thought was after his job, and [[Harry Potter]].

He made it clear that anyone in league with Dumbledore could consider themselves dismissed from the Ministry, leading to many members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] to become more discreet with their meetings. He also changed many laws in an attempt to stop Dumbledore and Potter from gathering supporters and reaching sympathetic ears, turning a simple case of under-age magic into a trial by the entire [[Wizengamot]]; in his great haste to withhold certain laws, he ended up neglecting a few, as well. He also invited Percy Weasley to become his Junior Minister in an attempt to spy on the Dumbledore-loyal [[Weasley family]]. Even though Percy accepted, he defected from his family due to a quarrel, though Fudge was allegedly gracious of this (at least, according to Percy).

[[File:Order-of-the-phoenix-fudge.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter]]
When Harry was accused of using magic illegally in the presence of a Muggle, Fudge took a leading role in Harry's prosecution before the [[Wizengamot]]. He actively sought to discredit Harry, going so far as to change the time and location of the hearing in an attempt to make him miss it. During the actual hearing, he introduced irrelevant considerations and highly biased accusations based around Harry's past offences which included offences he himself had excused, while at the same time seeking to deny Harry's right to a fair trial and present his side of the events. Only the intervention of witness [[Arabella Figg]] and Dumbledore himself spared Harry from expulsion, though Fudge attempted to deny their testimonies and unfairly voted for Harry's conviction himself. After the hearing, Fudge outright ignored Harry and Arthur Weasley as he walked past them.

====Sacking Albus Dumbledore====
{{Dialogue a-b-c-b-a|Cornelius Fudge|So, you intend to take on Dawlish, Shacklebolt, Dolores, and myself single-handed, do you, Dumbledore?|Albus Dumbledore|Merlin’s beard, no.

[[File:Kingsleywithfudge1.JPG|245px|thumb|Fudge in Albus Dumbledore's office with John Dawlish, Dolores Umbridge, and Kingsley Shacklebolt after the discovery of [[Dumbledore's Army]]]]
Driven by paranoia, Fudge sought to undermine Dumbledore's credibility and authority both at Hogwarts and at large in the wizarding world, which he accomplished, first by ensuring that Dumbledore was presented in the [[Daily Prophet|news]] as a crackpot. Soon afterwards, Fudge's Senior Undersecretary, [[Dolores Umbridge]], was installed at Hogwarts as the school's new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] Professor. Fudge had Umbridge teach Hogwarts students to read their textbooks instead of practising defensive spells, out of a paranoid belief that Dumbledore intended to train his students into an army to overtake the Ministry. By means of numerous Ministry [[Educational Decree|decrees]], Fudge gradually extended her powers while suppressing Dumbledore's and Harry's freedom of expressing their claims.

[[File:B5C27M3 Dumbledore's escape.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Fudge and others after  being defeated by Dumbledore]]
Fudge eventually handed full control of Hogwarts to Umbridge when, one evening, Harry was caught violating [[Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four]]. Umbridge had found Dumbledore's Army's meeting place and had quickly aprehended Harry. She found its location because of the information that was provided to her by [[Marietta Edgecombe]]. Dumbledore took the blame for the organisation and escaped after swiftly defeating Fudge, Umbridge, [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] and [[John Dawlish]], thus being dismissed as headmaster and became a wanted criminal.<ref name="OOTP"/>

After the [[Azkaban escapes#1996|mass breakout]] of [[Azkaban]] in 1996, Fudge continued to disbelieve Voldemort's return, instead suggesting that [[Sirius Black]] was the leader of the breakout, due to the fact that he and [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] were cousins, either unaware or neglecting that Sirius had been disowned by his family and the two were mortal enemies. Throughout all of this, Fudge unknowingly became an ally to Voldemort, giving him an entire year to rebuild his forces uninterrupted. Because Fudge ignored Dumbledore's previous warnings, Voldemort was also able to convince the Dementors, Giants and other factions mistreated by the Ministry to join him. The Dementors' defection also allowed Voldemort to free the majority of his loyal followers, including Bellatrix. Lucius, amongst other falsely-reformed Death Eaters, remained in Fudge's trust while discreetly manipulating him to assist their master and their own benefits. While the Order and Harry considered the possibility of Fudge being under the [[Imperius Curse]], Dumbledore believed otherwise, which was of no comfort. Within a year of his return, Voldemort had a sizeable, still-growing army at his disposal and was ready to begin his conquest.

Prior to Fudge's dismissal, he made desperate attempts to remain in office and [[Cornelius Fudge's letters to Albus Dumbledore (1996)|tried to have Dumbledore arrange a meeting with Harry]] to persuade him to tell the wizarding world that the Ministry was doing a good job in maintaining order and security (in short, Fudge wanted Harry to lie to the wizarding world, which is ironically what Fudge accused Harry of prior). This failed, as Dumbledore refused to make the arrangement, knowing that Harry would think the idea outrageous, but the idea did not die out when [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] took over. Indeed, when Harry was notified by Dumbledore that this idea was originally Fudge's, Harry expressed his disgust at the disgraced former Minister's shamelessness. Also, prior to his dismissal, Fudge was threatened by Voldemort to stand aside as Minister or a mass murder of Muggles would take place. Fudge refused, which resulted in the collapse of the [[Brockdale Bridge]].<ref name="HBP1"/>

Fudge stayed on as an [[Advisor to the Minister for Magic|adviser]] and messenger to the Muggle Prime Minister for Scrimgeour, as Scrimgeour was too busy to contact the Muggle Minister himself.<ref name="HBP1"/> It remains unknown if he complied with the new regime, was forced to go on the run, or was incarcerated alongside the Death Eaters' political enemies after Voldemort took over the government, but he did survive to at least [[2022]] and apparently did not fall towards the dark side enough to warrant an arrest.<ref name="RtH">''[[Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts]]'' (see this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrbCoZ3Or4g trailer])</ref>

===Legacy and later life {{C|post-1996}}===
{{Quote|Take the steps I have suggested, and you will be remembered, in office or out, as one of the bravest and greatest Ministers for Magic we have ever known. Fail to act, and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside, and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!|[[Albus Dumbledore]]'s warning to Fudge of how his actions of denial will make him go down in history as a disgrace, which proved prophetic|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
When the full consequences of Fudge's actions (or rather, lack thereof) after Lord Voldemort's return became known, the wizard community issued a virtually unanimous condemnation of his tenure. Fudge would later comment sadly that he had never known the wizard community to be so united on any other issue during his administration.<ref name="HBP1"/> Given this universal disapproval, he was likely memorialised, like Dumbledore warned, as one of the least effective Ministers in British history.

[[File:B6C30M1 funeral of Albus Dumbledore.png|250px|thumb|The funeral of Albus Dumbledore]]
In [[1997]], Fudge was one of the many wizards attending the [[funeral of Albus Dumbledore]].<ref name="HBP30">{{HBP|B|30}}</ref> It is unknown what happened to him after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] [[Fall of the British Ministry of Magic|took over]] the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] or his later life after [[Voldemort's Last Stand|Voldemort's final defeat]]. Whatever was the case, his most prized possession: his reputation and image, had been completely destroyed, as endangering the entire world, both Magic and Muggle, made him as Dumbledore had warned him; the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy what the wizarding community tried so hard to rebuild.

Despite Fudge's actions costing him his position and reputation, as well as endangering the community as a whole, the Ministry at the time did not learn any moral lessons from it, as his idea of persuading Harry to lie for the Ministry was taken up by his successor, [[Rufus Scrimgeour]], who also made similar mistakes of worrying about the bureaucracy's reputation over actual security. Fudge's corruption initiated a downward spiral that allowed Voldemort and his forces to eventually overthrow the Ministry, and Scrimgeour was killed because he walked the same political path as Fudge did. Only when the Ministry was retaken after Voldemort's death was [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] able to undo all the damage that Fudge and his administration had started.

In [[2022]], he did an exclusive interview with the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''.<ref name="RtH"/>
==Physical description==
Fudge was described as a "portly little man", with rumpled grey hair. He was recognisable by his lime green bowler hat, which he usually wore or held and often wore a pinstriped cloak, but not exclusively. When Harry Potter first saw him, Fudge was wearing a pinstriped suit, scarlet tie, long black travelling cloak, pointed purple boots, and lime green bowler hat.<ref name="POA3"/> On another occasion, he wore a bottle-green suit. For the execution of Buckbeak, he had a gold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoat.

The nationwide revelation that Voldemort has returned led Fudge to be stressed out, reflected in his careworn appearance when he met with the [[Muggle]] [[Prime Minister]]. Fudge was noticeably thinner, grayer, and balder, and with a crumpled look on his face, something the Prime Minister noted to be telltale signs of trouble for a politician.<ref name="HBP1"/>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|What other options does he have? He can hardly say, ‘Sorry everyone, Dumbledore warned me this might happen, the Azkaban guards have joined Lord Voldemort’ — stop whimpering, Ron — ‘and now Voldemort’s worst supporters have broken out too.’ I mean, he’s spent a good six months telling everyone you and Dumbledore are liars, hasn’t he?|Hermione Granger's reaction to Fudge's ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' interview about the Azkaban mass breakout of 1996|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
During his tenure as Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge appeared in the early years as a bumptious, good-natured wizard trying to manage and smooth over the occasional crisis, such as [[Harry Potter]]'s accidental misuse of magic to inflate his [[Marjorie Dursley|Aunt Marge]] in [[1993]].<ref name="POA3"/> Several people, including [[Rubeus Hagrid]], considered Fudge a well-meaning, but ineffective, bumbler while he was in office.<ref name="PS5"/>

[[Albus Dumbledore]] perceived Fudge as prejudiced towards those with [[Blood status|purity of blood]],<ref name="GOF36">{{GOF|B|36}}</ref> a trait which he shared with other Ministry officials such as [[Dolores Umbridge]]<ref name="DH13">{{DH|B|13}}</ref> and [[Lucius Malfoy]], both of whom Fudge favoured and patronised.<ref name="COS4">{{COS|B|4}}</ref> While Fudge favoured those with high status and blood purity, he overlooked and disapproved of people such as [[Arthur Weasley]], on the account that he "lacked wizarding pride" and had a "fondness for [[Non-magic people|Muggles]]".<ref name="GOF35">{{GOF|B|35}}</ref> He was also disinterested in [[Squib]]s such as [[Arabella Figg]].<ref name="OOTP8">{{OOTP|B|8}}</ref> In two cases, he irrationally accused [[half-giant]]s of murder; first [[Rubeus Hagrid]] of opening the [[Chamber of Secrets]],<ref name="COS14"/> and later [[Olympe Maxime]] of killing [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Barty Crouch]] on account of her species.<ref name="GOF31">{{GOF|B|31}}</ref> When Dumbledore offered to summon the [[house-elf]] [[Dobby]] to the [[Disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter|hearing]] of [[Harry Potter]] for testimony, Fudge stated that he had no time to listen to house-elves.<ref name="OOTP8"/> He overlooked Lucius Malfoy's past association with the [[Death Eaters]] after Malfoy had been cleared, having claimed to be under the [[Imperius Curse]], as well as his vaunted position in wizarding society and financial contributions to the Ministry.

Fudge could be quite tactless, using exaggerated gestured to communicate with [[Oblansk]], the [[Bulgaria]]n Minister for Magic,<ref name="GOF8"/> and revolted aloud upon seeing [[Marietta Edgecombe]]'s disfigured face.<ref name="OOTP27"/> Later in his career, Fudge awarded himself the [[Order of Merlin]], First Class, a decision that sparked controversy within the wizarding community, where critics argued his tenure had not warranted such recognition.<ref name="PMordermerlin"/>

{{Dialogue a-b|Cornelius Fudge|Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore.|Albus Dumbledore|Of course they can. And you certainly seem to be making many changes, Cornelius. Why, in the few short weeks since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot, it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic!|Cornelius Fudge and Albus Dumbledore arguing|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

Fudge ultimately tried to maintain a semblance of peace, though this was achieved through controversial and illiberal methods, leveraging the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' for a [[Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter|smear campaign]] on his rivals and publicly disgracing them to protect his own reputation. Preferring to tell the public what they wanted to hear instead of what they needed to hear, and deluding even himself in the process, Fudge would use virtually any means to cover up the truth.<ref name="OOTP5"/> At times, he was happy to bend the laws in his favour, including temporarily pardoning [[Willy Widdershins]] for his crimes because he made a deal with the Ministry for his release to provide testimony against [[Harry Potter]] for forming [[Dumbledore's Army]], showing that he was even willing to make deals with criminals if it meant discrediting those who opposed him.<ref name="OOTP27"/> By installing [[Dolores Umbridge]] as his puppet [[Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Headmistress]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], he created several new [[Educational Decree|rules and regulations]] at Hogwarts to increase control over the school, many of them unfair.<ref name="OOTP17">{{OOTP|B|17}}</ref> Ultimately, his refusal to accept the truth of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s return put the British wizarding community at further risk.

Fudge also appeared to be more reactive than proactive. He could also be quite indecisive, and would often ask Dumbledore for advice in his early days as Minister.<ref name="PS5">{{PS|B|5}}</ref> When Fudge ''did'' take the initiative to make decisions, they were often misguided. When he placed [[Dementor]]s at Hogwarts to recapture [[Sirius Black]], this led to students being traumatised and a number of near-death experiences involving [[Harry Potter]].<ref name="POA9">{{POA|B|9}}</ref><ref name="POA20">{{POA|B|20}}</ref> He later insisted on summoning a Dementor to [[Bartemius Crouch Junior]]'s interrogation for his own protection, despite knowing that Barty had been [[Incarcerous Spell|restrained]] and guarded by [[Professor]] [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]], and the possibility that the Dementor would attack the prisoner on sight, which did happen, resulting in the destruction of their most critical piece of evidence at that time.<ref name="GOF36"/>
[[File:Poster of Cornelius Fudge.png|left|thumb|250px|To reinforce his position as Minister, Fudge had a large magical portrait banner of himself hanging in the [[Atrium]]]]
Although his behaviour between [[1995]] and [[1996]] made him appear irrational, Fudge was not a totally unreasonable man and was more reasonable than [[Dolores Umbridge]] or [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] by nature, as he simply buried himself in his own self-denial, love of office, delusions and paranoia. He was capable of admitting when he was wrong, but only with damnable and solid evidence which he could see with his own eyes. After witnessing Voldemort's return with his own eyes, Fudge could no longer bury himself in lies and cleared Dumbledore's and Harry's names alongside the names of notable members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] unjustly persecuted by the Ministry (most notably [[Rubeus Hagrid]], [[Arthur Weasley]], and [[Sirius Black]]), at the price of him being removed from his position. For instance, he was able to admit to the Muggle Prime Minister, with somewhat humility, that starting a ruthless manhunt for Sirius Black may have been aimless since he was in fact innocent all along, which Fudge realised when he learned that Black was killed by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] (despite incorrectly believing earlier that the two were working together).<ref name="HBP1"/>

Although being willing to admit his mistake to the public, Fudge was desperate in maintaining the position of Minister. He refused to resign despite pressure from the community and a legitimate threat from Voldemort, and made a ridiculous attempt to revitalise his popularity, by bombarding Dumbledore with [[Cornelius Fudge's letters to Albus Dumbledore (1996)|letters]] trying to get him to persuade Harry to lie to the public on Fudge's behalf (which Fudge hypocritically accused Harry of doing a year prior), a failed attempt that was picked up by his successor with equal unsuccess. Because Fudge refused to step down willingly, the wizarding community dismissed him unanimously; Fudge was greatly saddened to see the entire world being so united against him. After his failed attempt to recruit Harry to be his poster boy, Cornelius bitterly wished his successor, [[Rufus Scrimgeour]], to have better success in the endeavour.<ref name="HBP1"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Quote|Fudge pulled out his wand, conjured two large glasses full of amber liquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the Prime Minister’s hand, and drew up a chair.|Fudge conjuring whiskey|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
Despite rarely being shown to use [[magic]], Fudge was shown to use some rather advanced, or at least difficult, [[spell]]s. However, he seems to be limited with certain areas of magic, as he could not remove Hermione's [[Dumbledore's Army parchment jinx|"SNEAK" jinx]] off of [[Marietta Edgecombe]]'s face.<ref>{{OOTP|B|27}} - Fudge states "Haven't we got a [[counter-jinx]] for this?", implying he does not know how to remove the word "SNEAK" from Marietta's face</ref> He also had very little political skills, as he would bombard Dumbledore for advice in his early years,<ref name="PS5"/> while making very poor choices in the last few years of his tenure.

Dumbledore effortlessly defeated Fudge, Umbridge and Dawlish and put a hex on Kingsley to make it convincing since Kingsley was a member of the Order of the Phoenix. The fact that he was willing to challenge Dumbledore, even with backup, suggests that he had some skill in combat.<ref name="OOTP27">{{OOTP|B|27}}</ref>

==Relationships==
===Albus Dumbledore===
{{Quote|Deep down, Fudge knows Dumbledore's much cleverer than he is, a much more powerful wizard, and in the early days of his Ministry he was forever asking Dumbledore for help and advice. But it seems that he's become fond of power now, and much more confident. He loves being [[Minister for Magic]], and he's managed to convince himself that he's the clever one and Dumbledore's simply stirring up trouble for the sake of it.|[[Remus Lupin]] on Cornelius Fudge's attempts to discredit Dumbledore|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:600full-Albus-Dumbledore-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-photo.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Albus Dumbledore]], his perceived rival and enemy]]
In Fudge's early days as [[Minister for Magic]], he was forever bombarding Albus Dumbledore for help and advice. In return, he expressed confidence in Dumbledore. When [[Lucius Malfoy]] had an Order of Suspension for Dumbledore due to his failure to prevent petrification-attacks on students, Fudge was against the suspension, saying it was the "''last thing we want just now''", and "''if Dumbledore can't stop them... who can?''".

Besides advice, it seems that Albus Dumbledore informed Fudge of important events at Hogwarts, such as Sirius Black's and Buckbeak's escape from there being due to "a reversal of time." Apparently, he did not inform Fudge that [[Harry Potter]] was a [[Parseltongue|Parselmouth]], and learned of it after [[Rita Skeeter]]'s article in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''.

Over the years, though, Fudge became paranoid that Dumbledore was seeking the Minister position for himself, despite Dumbledore clearly showing lack of interest in the position, rejecting it at least three times. This paranoia was kept suppressed, as Fudge continued to respect Dumbledore over the years and accepted his decisions, despite their eccentricity. Despite constantly seeking advice from the more able wizard, Fudge would nevertheless succumb to the public's views and sometimes go against Dumbledore's insistence on certain issues, such as sending Hagrid to [[Azkaban]] or placing [[Dementor]]s around [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] as guardians. Fudge was only successful in gaining the people's confidence because they knew he was willing to accept Dumbledore's advice.

{{Quote|They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin’ fer advice.|Rubeus Hagrid regarding Fudge's lack of confidence as Minister|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
However, in 1995, after Dumbledore told him that Voldemort had returned, Fudge refused to believe him, even when Severus Snape showed him the reactivated [[Dark Mark]], as he finally succumbed to his paranoia. As a result, Fudge started a [[Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter|smear campaign]] to discredit and ruin Albus's reputation, ungratefully rejecting and forgetting all the assistance and advice he received from Dumbledore for the past years. As an attempt to wrest control of Hogwarts from Dumbledore, he appointed [[Dolores Umbridge]] as the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher against the headmaster's will, and [[Educational Decree|empowered]] her greatly and eventually attempted (in failure) to arrest Dumbledore on a trumped-up charge.

After seeing Voldemort's return in the Ministry, Fudge was forced to accept it all as well as reinstate Albus's reputation. Following this, Fudge was kicked out of office in disgrace because he refused to take the steps Dumbledore offered him. When Fudge requested Dumbledore to persuade Harry Potter to lie for his behalf to the wizarding world in a last ditch effort to cling onto his position, Dumbledore refused, seeing no more desire or purpose in helping Cornelius.

In 1997, Fudge attended Dumbledore's funeral, with a miserable expression on his face and twirling his green bowler. Harry had wondered whether any of the Ministry officials who showed up were genuinely saddened by Dumbledore's death or simply putting up a façade.

===Harry Potter===
{{Quote|After everything Fudge did last year? After ''Umbridge''?|Harry showing anger and disgust at Fudge's shamelessness|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Harry Potter movies hbp promostills 6.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Harry Potter]], whom he tried to slander]]
Initially, Fudge treated Harry Potter like an honorary nephew and gave him lenience when the underage wizard accidentally inflated his aunt [[Marjorie Dursley|Marge]] from his anger, rather than expel him, despite a previous offence (which was actually [[Dobby]]'s doing). This was partly due to the [[Azkaban]] [[Azkaban escapes#1993|escapee]] [[Sirius Black]], who Fudge believed to be seeking to return to Voldemort. However, in a misguided attempt to protect Harry, Fudge was too reluctant to tell the boy about Black's supposed goals as well as Harry's importance as Black's godson. In addition, Fudge refused to listen to Harry and Hermione's attempts to explain Sirius's innocence, instead going with [[Severus Snape]]'s suggestion that they might have been [[Confundus Charm|confunded]]. Harry initially thought fairly well of Fudge, regarding him as a somewhat blustering and pompous, but essentially good-natured person.<ref name="POA21">{{POA|B|21}}</ref>

This kindly relationship continued until the end of the [[Triwizard Tournament]], when Harry brought back [[Cedric Diggory]]'s corpse and explained Voldemort's return to Dumbledore. Fudge, in fear that this would jeopardise the peace of his community and his seat as Minister for Magic, refused to believe Harry and Dumbledore and spread a smear campaign to make it look like they were liars and nutters who were trying to gain attention as well as take over the Ministry; his decision had partly been influenced by Rita Skeeter's writings, believing Harry to be hallucinating and that being a Parselmouth made him even more untrustworthy. Because of this, Fudge transformed Harry's disciplinary hearing of underage magic used to defend against Dementors into a heavily biased full-court trial, made the ''Daily Prophet'' print slander stories against him as though he was something of a slip-in joke, and granted Umbridge many new privileges to extensively punish and torment the boy. One of Fudge's ultimate goals was to expel Potter from Hogwarts and oust him from the magical community as an untrustworthy troublemaker.

At first, Harry was shocked by Fudge's blatant denial and somewhat desperate in regaining recognition during the trial, which did not occur, while, in extension, unsuccessfully trying to persuade his right-hand woman Umbridge. However, as Fudge's antagonism continued, Harry lost faith in the Minister and began to feel more disgusted at Fudge's increasingly tyrannical hold; Harry only felt more angry when Fudge chose to blame the Azkaban mass breakout on Sirius instead of accepting that Voldemort had returned. When Fudge came to Hogwarts to deal with the Dumbledore's Army business, he sneered at the captured Harry, who replied with the dirtiest look he could muster and thought it was worth watching Fudge's blood pressure rise from anger by denying his transgression of [[Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four]].

When undeniable evidence of Voldemort's return was finally given, Fudge, in a last ditch effort to remain in office, tried to persuade Harry to lie to the wizarding world (which ironically was what he had accused Harry of for a whole year) that the Ministry was doing a good job in security. This failed, as Harry hated Fudge for his actions and held him in contempt. When Harry was notified that Fudge had the gall to attempt to even ask him for such a favour, he expressed anger and disgust at the former Minister's shamelessness.

===Dolores Umbridge===
{{Quote|What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him.|Umbridge attempting to break the law behind Fudge's back|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Dolores Umbridge DHF1 promotional image.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Dolores Umbridge]], his former associate who had little regard for his authority]]
Dolores Umbridge was Fudge's right-hand woman, being his Senior-Undersecretary, and he trusted her greatly to place her into Hogwarts to control it. He granted her many powers through his [[Educational Decree]]s, and full-heartedly agreed with all of her comments and mockeries against Dumbledore and Harry. It is unclear whether Fudge knew the extent of Umbridge's sadistic and dark nature, but Umbridge was loyal to Fudge only because of the power he was offering her, and felt no true attachments to the misguided man.

She was also willing to break the law behind the Minister's back to get what she wanted, such as summoning [[Dementor]]s in an attempt to either incapacitate Harry or force him to produce a [[Patronus Charm]] as an excuse to have him expelled as well as using the illegal [[Cruciatus Curse]] for interrogation, all the while stating that "what Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him".

Curiously, however, in spite of believing Fudge would draw a line there, and in spite of Umbridge often and unfairly receiving far more blame (mostly from Hogwarts) than Fudge for everything that happened that year, both of them were immoral in very similar ways. Still, Umbridge ultimately used Fudge to further her lust for power, making him think she was a mindless extension of his own hunger. When Fudge was dismissed, Umbridge stood beside the new Ministers instead.

===Lucius Malfoy===
{{Dialogue a-b|Lucius Malfoy|Shall we go up to your office, then, Minister?|Cornelius Fudge|Certainly. This way, Lucius.|Fudge being manipulated by Lucius Malfoy|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Lucius Malfoy Profile.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Lucius Malfoy]], his former associate]]
Fudge had a close professional association with Lucius Malfoy who was a wealthy and respectable [[pure-blood]]. (Lucius was cleared in 1981 of serving Lord Voldemort, claiming to have been under the [[Imperius Curse]], which Fudge believed absolutely.) This association may have encouraged Fudge's own belief in the superiority of pure-bloods over those with mixed parentage, as well as "half-breeds" and creatures with "near-human intelligence" which his senior assistant, Umbridge, expressed. Fudge admired Lucius for giving donations of gold to the right causes.

In return, Fudge granted him many privileges, such as personal access to him, favours in delaying laws and revealing classified information (e.g. the Triwizard Tournament). Fudge gave Lucius tickets to sit in the top box for the [[Quidditch World Cup]] final after his generous gift to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]]. Fudge first met [[Narcissa Malfoy]] and [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] there in the top box, which suggests the Malfoys and Fudges did not meet socially prior to that. Despite receiving the Minister's favours, Lucius caused him great embarrassment by secretly leading the unconvicted Death Eaters and anti-Muggle supporters in a riot that night.

[[File:Fudge Lucius.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Lucius and Fudge]]
Fudge did have disagreements with Lucius and his views. For instance, Fudge did not oppose Arthur Weasley's [[Muggle Protection Act]], and allowed Ministry officials to conduct raids on wizard homes (later including Lucius's), searching for artefacts harmful to Muggles. This may have turned Lucius back to the Dark Arts as his plot to re-open the [[Chamber of Secrets]] and discredit Arthur Weasley came about when he did not get his way. Then, when the twelve school governors [[Order of Suspension|suspended]] Dumbledore for not being able to prevent the Chamber of Secrets incident, Fudge said it was the wrong thing to do but did not use the law to interfere with the running of Hogwarts as he would later.

After Harry survived Voldemort's rebirth and reported to him that Lucius was one of the [[Death Eaters]] who came to the re-gathering after receiving the Dark Mark invitation, Fudge took this as a great personal offence and absolutely refused to believe it, continuing to treat Lucius with great respect and meeting him at the Ministry. He said Harry was just throwing out names of people who were cleared thirteen years previously and began a campaign to discredit Harry and Dumbledore. The next year, when Lucius's son, Draco Malfoy, captured Harry for being in the illegal organisation calling itself [[Dumbledore's Army]], Fudge commented that his father must be informed of this achievement.

Fudge was completely oblivious to Lucius's dark nature. Lucius, in turn, used this to his advantage and manipulated the gullible Minister to delay laws and other factors that would benefit the Death Eaters. By the time Lucius was caught red-handed as a renewed Death Eater, Lord Voldemort had a year to regain power and followers while being unopposed by the Ministry, making it that much harder for his successor to protect the [[wizarding world]] even with Lucius being locked up in [[Azkaban]]. As a result, Fudge suffered almost exactly the same consequences as Lucius: both lost their positions of influence while desperately and unsuccessfully trying to reclaim it.

===Amelia Bones===
[[File:Amelia Bones.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Amelia Bones]], who had once respected Fudge, but came to despise him]]
Fudge's relationship with Amelia before he had launched an unjustified [[Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter|smear campaign]] against both Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter is unknown. But it is quite reasonable to assume that they had a mutual respect towards each other. Despite this, when Fudge had begun his campaign against Dumbledore and Harry, misusing his power, attempting to twist the laws and even threatening to dismiss members of the Ministry who supported them, Amelia's trust and respect for him began to diminish.

During Harry's [[Disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter|disciplinary hearing]], Amelia finally saw Fudge for who he truly was: an arrogant, cowardly, corrupt, dishonourable, delusional, dishonest, incompetent, selfish and tyrannical hypocrite. Amelia was completely enraged and disgusted by Fudge's mistreatment of Harry, who was falsely accused and wrongfully expelled from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] for alleged underage use of magic in the presence of a Muggle.

Despite Fudge's attempts to intimidate and purge anyone at the Ministry who supported Harry or Dumbledore, Amelia successfully maintained fairness and impartiality during the trial. She did so by disregarding Fudge's threats and ensuring that Harry was given a voice, countering the biased accusations stemming from his past actions and behaviour at school. Also, Amelia did not allow Fudge to dismiss [[Arabella Figg]]'s testimony simply because she was a [[Squib]], as Fudge hoped to discredit Harry's claims about Voldemort's resurrection.

But unfortunately for Fudge, Amelia had coldly reminded him about the operational guidelines of the wizarding world laws. She highlighted the accused's entitlement to speak up, provide witnesses, and present evidence in their defence. Also, Amelia made it clear that Harry's past actions and behaviour at school were not relevant to the current trial. She proved that Harry's use of magic in the presence of a Muggle was purely an act of self-defence. Amelia further pointed out the laws of the wizarding world, which allowed underage wizards or witches to use magic in the presence of Muggles if the circumstances were presented as a threat to everyone's safety.

Afterwards, almost all the other members of the ruling court, including Amelia, voted in favour of Harry's complete exoneration from the accusations. Fudge, who was left with no choice, was compelled to reluctantly acquit Harry since he, Umbridge, and a few other members of the court were completely out-voted, much to Fudge's complete dismay and humiliation.

After the trial, Amelia completely lost any trust and respect that she once had for Fudge, particularly because she knew that Dumbledore and Harry were being honest about Voldemort's return, while Fudge had delusionally constructed stories to protect his own reputation. Fudge claimed that Dumbledore was after his job and that Harry was an attention-seeker. Fudge's baseless claims were nothing but complete and utter nonsense, as he knew deep down that Voldemort had indeed returned, especially considering evidence like [[Severus Snape]]'s [[Dark Mark]] becoming active once again. But he had still ignored the truth because he prioritised his position as Minister for Magic over the safety of the wizarding community.

After Voldemort's public revelation of his return, Fudge was ousted from office as Minister for Magic, and his reputation was damaged beyond repair. Amelia did not have any compassion, empathy or sympathy towards the ex-Minister. As far as Amelia was concerned, Fudge got exactly what he deserved for his misdeeds.

Sometime later, after Amelia had died in a battle against Voldemort, Fudge was saddened by her death. He viewed Amelia's passing as an immense tragedy, implying that he still had respect left for her despite the role that Amelia had played in his own humiliation during Harry's disciplinary hearing.

===Arthur Weasley===
[[File:Arthur Weasley profile.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Arthur Weasley]], whom he ignored and neglected]]
As Arthur was a lower-class person and having a poor family, Fudge always neglected him while having a manipulated friendship with his wealthy rival, Lucius Malfoy, due to Fudge's swaying of money and power. As Arthur was considered an odd duck due to his fascination with Muggle culture, Fudge was able to use that as an excuse that Mr Weasley "did not fit" into the Ministry norm and that he was unfit for promotion to higher office. However, despite his disapproval and neglect of Arthur, Fudge did not oppose Arthur's Muggle Protection Act, as he was also accepting towards Muggles, and he once allowed Arthur and his family to sit at the Top Box during the Quiddich World Cup.

When Lord Voldemort had returned, Fudge suspected Arthur being in league with Dumbledore since he was aware that the two of them were friendly. He even invited Arthur's son Percy to become his Junior Assistant in an attempt to spy on the Weasley family and Dumbledore, which led to Percy defecting from his family after a row with Arthur. Fudge ignored Arthur and Harry's existences when he and the Wizengamot exited Courtroom Ten. After Fudge was ousted from office in disgrace, Arthur was instantly promoted by Fudge's successor.

===Prime Minister of Muggles===
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Fudge|Prime Minister, I am very sorry to have to tell you that he's back. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back.|Prime Minister|Back? When you say 'back'...he's alive? I mean —|Yes, alive. That is- I don't know- is a man alive if he can't be killed? I don't really understand it, and [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] won't explain properly- but anyway, he's certainly got a body and is walking and talking and killing, so I suppose, for the purposes of our discussion, yes, he's alive.|Cornelius Fudge and Prime Minister of Muggles about Lord Voldemort|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
Because of his position, Fudge was able to contact the Prime Minister of Muggles whenever the wizarding world faced a crisis most likely affecting Muggles. In [[1996]], when [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] returned and Fudge had been forced out as Minister for Magic, he went to alert the [[Prime Minister|Muggle Minister]] concerning the return of Voldemort. He also visited when the Prime Minister was elected, when [[Sirius Black]] escaped from [[Azkaban]].

===Percy Weasley===
[[File:Peciee.PNG|200px|thumb|left|[[Percy Weasley]], his Junior Minister]]
Percy Weasley and [[Weasley family|his family]] were originally looked down on by Fudge due to their lack of wealth and having more affiliation with Muggles.

However, in 1995, Fudge promoted Percy to become his Junior Minister. This was an attempt to spy on the [[Weasley family]], but Percy's defection from his family made it pointless. However, Percy commented in his [[Percy Weasley's letter to Ronald Weasley (II)|letter]] to his younger brother [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] that the Minister would not be more gracious to him for this defection, and he agreed with Fudge on that Harry was violent and disturbed and Dumbledore was plotting to overthrow Fudge when the Ministry began publishing articles, leading to a quarrel with his family. By Percy's claim, Fudge was actually glad that Percy left his family for the sake of the Ministry. This may have been a contradiction, as this meant Percy was no longer a source of information of the Weasley family's involvement with Dumbledore and Potter.

Over the final year of Fudge's term as Minister, he kept using Percy as the court scribe for both [[Disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter|Harry's disciplinary hearing]] and the [[Dumbledore's Army#Discovery|discovery of Dumbledore's Army]]. Percy, during both moments, heartily agreed with Fudge's decisions and even laughed when Fudge made insulting mockeries at Harry and Dumbledore. When Fudge's folly had been eventually exposed and he was ousted from office in disgrace, Percy remained loyal to the Ministry but did not show any sympathy for Fudge after his dismissal.

===Barty Crouch Senior===
{{Quote|I see two possibilities, [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Alastor]]. Either Crouch has finally cracked — more than likely, I’m sure you’ll agree, given his personal history — lost his mind, and gone wandering off somewhere —|Fudge expressing a contemptuous lack of interest in the disappearance of his rival Barty Crouch Senior|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Barty Crouch Senior GOFF promo.jpg|200px|thumb|Bartemius Crouch Senior, his enemy and political rival]]
Fudge had a huge hatred for [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Barty Crouch Snr]]. This was because of Barty being one of his main competitors during the election for Minister of Magic in 1990, where he was jealous of how much Crouch was admired in the Ministry. Despite winning, the election left Fudge with such a strong dislike of Crouch, so much that, Fudge's first act as Minister of Magic was to have Crouch reassigned to the Department of International Magical Cooperation, using Crouch's falling popularity after Crouch's son's trial to his advantage. Fudge's dislike of Crouch was strong to the point where he refused to take Crouch seriously when Crouch vanished after trying to warn Dumbledore about his son and Voldemort despite being in a delusional state, Fudge simply dismissed his warnings as the ramblings of a lunatic, and refused to believe the real reason he was gone until he was forced to acknowledge Voldemort's return the following year.

This dislike also extended to Crouch's son, as he believed Crouch Jnr was not a true Death Eater and that he only acted through insanity rather than his loyalty to Voldemort, calling him as a lunatic just like his father, and had no regret about Crouch Jnr receiving the Dementors Kiss and therefore ending the Crouch family line, even though Crouch Jnr could no longer testify Voldemort's return as a result. Despite his dislike of Crouch Snr, Fudge apparently required Crouch for translating foreign wizards and creatures who didn't understand English, as he struggled to communicate with the Bulgarian Minister of Magic (who was pretending to not understand English in order to prank Fudge) during the Quidditch World Cup while Crouch was absent.

It is unknown what Crouch thought of Fudge, although given his serious and rule abiding nature, he likely disliked Fudge in turn for his bumbling and incompetent nature and for reassigning him to the Department of International Magical Cooperation, which permanently ruined any further chances of Crouch becoming Minister of Magic despite his fall in popularity.

===Magical community===
{{Quote|The whole wizarding community has been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight. I've never known them so united in my whole term of office!|Fudge sadly commenting on how the world turned against him|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
When Fudge first ascended his ranks to the Minister for Magic, his bumbling nature failed to worry the citizens as long as he was willing to take advice from more able people such as Albus Dumbledore. However, Fudge never forgot how much the community supported Dumbledore to become the Minister in the past. As his position was the leader of the entire government, he was nevertheless highly influenced and affected by the opinion of the people as a whole. When a few people would oppose his rule which threatened his administration, he would abuse his powers to discredit such people to maintain his hold on the likings of the rest of them as well as threatening any employees with dismissal for not supporting his rule; ironically, Fudge only became popular because he took Dumbledore's advice to begin with. When Fudge awarded himself with the [[Order of Merlin]], First Class medal, it caused controversies throughout the community, as it was common view that Fudge's career was "less than distinguished".<ref name="PMordermerlin"/>

However, by ignoring Dumbledore's and Potter's warning of Voldemort's return, Fudge endangered the entire world, and despite his increasingly tyrannical hold on them, about half of the British wizard community chose to believe Dumbledore and Potter instead. When undeniable evidence of the truth finally came out, the entire community issued a virtually unanimous condemnation of Fudge's tenure, while Fudge made one last (unsuccessful) attempt to lie to them to regain their trust, which would have further endangered them by denying more preparation. Fudge was ultimately removed from office after two weeks of pressure and was remembered by history, as Dumbledore had warned him, "''as the man who stepped aside, and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild''".

===Lord Voldemort===
{{Quote|It is with great regret that I must confirm that the wizard styling himself Lord — well, you know who I mean — is alive and among us again.|Fudge finally admitting to the return of Lord Voldemort in the [[Daily Prophet]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Voldemort Headshot DHP1.png|200px|thumb|left|Lord Voldemort, whom he feared immensely]]
As with the majority of the wizarding world, Fudge deeply feared [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], to the point of being unable to say his name aloud, using the evasive alternatives or writing it out. Fudge preferred the peace and tranquillity that came with Voldemort's first downfall that he refused to spoil it as long as there was insufficient evidence of his return. His fear and self-denial led him to campaign to discredit those who tried to say Voldemort was back, instead of making preparations of ensuring their victory and safety in the upcoming war. Cornelius continuously sought excuses of the increasing disappearances and the Azkaban mass breakout instead of accepting the fact that the most evil Dark Wizard has came back.

Only when seeing Voldemort in the flesh did Fudge accept the Dark Lord's return. Voldemort was able to take full advantage of Cornelius's besotted moves to rebuild his forces with no interference, and by the time the truth came out, it was too late for the disgraced Minister to defend the community. Despite his fear, Cornelius refused to stand aside when Voldemort threatened him with mass murder of Muggles. Voldemort followed through with his threat, destroying the [[Brockdale Bridge]], leading to many Muggles' deaths, which caused more trouble for Fudge's administration.

</gallery>

==Etymology==
*Cornelius is an old Roman clan's name, possibly related to the Latin word ''cornu'' (horn). Name of early Christian saints with a mediaeval cult in the Low Countries.
*Oswald is of old Germanic origin, and means "godly rule" or "power of a god" (from Anglo-Saxon ''ós'', which means "god" in a polytheistic context, and ''weald'', "rule"). This is a reference of Fudge's political power amongst the British wizarding world is the highest, to the point of god-like. The name Oswald has had negative connotations since the 1930s due to British Fascist leader {{W|Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley}} - and ally of {{W|Adolf Hitler}} - as well as {{w|Lee Harvey Oswald}} - assassin of U.S. President John F. Kennedy - since the 1960s. Both can allude to Fudge's negative impact upon the wizarding world, the former due to his blood purity and social elitism, as exemplified by his favouritism of Lucius Malfoy, and the latter due to his attempt to assassinate Dumbledore's reputation.
*Fudge (verb): To alter something from its true state, as to hide a flaw or uncertainty. Always deliberate, but not necessarily dishonest or immoral. 
**(intransitive) To try to avoid giving a direct answer; to waffle or equivocate.
**"''Fudge''", besides being a toffee-like confection (though softer, and crumbly rather than chewy), can mean "nonsense". This meaning originated from (probably 18th-century) sailors;<ref name="snark">Martin Gardner, ''The Annotated "Hunting of the Snark"'', W. W. Norton and Company, 2006; footnote 60</ref> it was derived from a merchant-Captain Fudge, who was renowned as a teller of tall tales. As a verb, it means to "evade" or to "falsify". In technological jargon, it means "to perform in an incomplete but marginally acceptable way."

==Behind the scenes==
<!--- Please do not provide commentary in this section comparing Cornelius Fudge to Donald Trump, unless a consensus is reached in a talk page discussion. This is extremely speculative, contentious and irrelevant, considering it is a wholly real world analogy invented by some fans, but likely to be disagreed upon by others. Thank you.--->

[[File:LEGOfudge.png|200px|thumb|Fudge as a LEGO minifigure]]
*Cornelius Fudge was portrayed in the {{HPfilms}} by the late [[Robert Hardy]]. He appeared in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Chamber of Secrets]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Goblet of Fire]]'', and ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Order of the Phoenix]]''.
**Fudge's appearance in ''Goblet of Fire'', however, is very brief, and only his voice is heard with him not being visible at any point in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Half-Blood Prince]]''.
*Fudge will be portrayed by Bertie Carvel in the upcoming [[Harry Potter (TV series)|HBO ''Harry Potter'' television series]].
*Fudge sports a hairstyle unusual for the time period in the 2nd film.
*Fudge was voiced by [[Dov Reiser]] in a dub of the fifth video game.
*While Fudge avoids using Voldemort's name throughout the series, to the point of being rude to the Muggle Prime Minister when he began to read it aloud, Fudge calls him "Lord Voldemort" in the [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|fourth book]].
*It is always mentioned in the books that Fudge sports a lime green bowler hat, however in the films, Fudge is shown wearing a black bowler hat. He is also not as short as he is described to be in the books.
*Fudge is described in {{POA}} with a gold pocket watch, yet in the films he is shown with a [[Cornelius Fudge's pocket watch|silver pocket watch]].
*In {{GOF|FA}}, both Fudge's order for the Dementor's Kiss on Barty Crouch Jnr, and the beginning of his doubt of Dumbledore and Harry, were omitted. The latter part is covered in the following film.
*In {{OOTP|FA}}:
**Fudge's removal from office via resignation is revealed. In the books, Fudge's removal, a sacking, was revealed in {{HBP}}.
***This difference in the film shows that Fudge was more willing to own up to his mistakes and willingly resign, unlike the books, where it was mentioned he initially fought to try to remain in power, despite his actions were only making things worse until he was forced out of his position via a sacking.
**Fudge didn't seem as antagonistic towards Harry and Dumbledore as he was in the book, though this was simply because he was not given much screen-time in comparison to the novel or possibly because in the films, antagonism between some characters is reduced to being less obnoxious than in the novels.
**A banner of Fudge is shown in the Ministry [[Atrium]] and it depicts the Minister in the style of 1930s posters from the former Soviet Union. During Dumbledore and Voldemort's duel, the broken shards of glass tear the banner apart, foreshadowing Fudge's term as minister ending in disgrace.
*Cornelius Fudge is similar to [[Hector Fawley]], who served as Minister of Magic fifty years earlier, in that both did not take seriously enough the threat posed by the [[Dark wizard]]s of their time ([[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] in Fudge's time and [[Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]] in Fawley's time) to the wizarding community, and both had to leave their position because of it. Fudge even denied Voldemort's return. 
*Cornelius Fudge is also similar to [[Torquil Travers]], who served as the Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] in Fawley's time, in that both feared that [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] was conspiring with his friends against them, and therefore they did not like Dumbledore and did not trust him.
<!-- Please provide sources for these comparisons, so that these are presented as records of what's going on in the fandom, rather than mere thoughts of editors.
*Several comparisons have been made between Fudge and real-life [[Great Britain|British]] Prime Minister {{W|Neville Chamberlain}}, who gave in to Adolf Hitler at the Munich Conference and foolishly announced "peace in our time" in [[1938]], shortly before the outbreak of World War II. Despite any of his other accomplishments, he has largely had a historical reputation as a bumbler. However, there are a number of major differences between them:
**Chamberlain was a pacifist whilst Fudge was a coward.
**By all accounts, Chamberlain was a proper politician, who used his power to try and benefit Britain. In contrast, Fudge was corrupt and deliberately abused his power in his final year in office.
**Although it later came back to haunt him, Chamberlain did genuinely try to negotiate peace with Hitler. Fudge, meanwhile acted as if Voldemort was still dead, denying the possibility that war was just around the corner.
**Despite his reassurances of peace, Chamberlain did use the time provided to secretly start re-arming, whilst Fudge deliberately tried to deny the citizens and students vital skill sets needed to combat their enemies (and therefore gave Voldemort a huge advantage).
**When it became clear that his peace attempts had failed, Chamberlain took full responsibility for his actions. Fudge meanwhile refused to acknowledge that he been in the wrong and continued to try and manipulate both Harry and Dumbledore in order to retain his position.
**Although history would later condemn him, Chamberlain resigned with integrity and his reputation intact. Pledging his full support to his successor, Winston Churchill, Chamberlain who died in 1940, continued to do what he could to help the allies win the war. In comparison, Fudge desperately tried to remain in power, going so far as to ask Dumbledore to arrange a meeting with Harry, in order to try and convince the boy to lie that, under his leadership, the Ministry was winning the war. Dumbledore refused to do so and Fudge was forced to resign in complete disgrace. Following Voldemort's take over of the Ministry, he simply disappeared and his contributions, if he made any, remain unknown.
**Ironically, actor Robert Hardy was well known for playing Chamberlain's successor, [[Winston Churchill]], in a series of television miniseries. -->
*Fudge entered office in [[1990]], the same year as real-life British Prime Minister Sir {{W|John Major}}.
*Fudge's wand in the films has a striking resemblance to [[Filius Flitwick's wand]].
*There was a real person named Cornelius Fudge, who was a naval captain on the H.M.S. London in the [[19th century]]. However, [[J. K. Rowling]] has denied basing Minister Fudge's name off of this person or any other real personage, saying as much in a letter to John Jeffries, the owner of a narwhal tusk that had been engraved to the real Fudge. Despite the two characters not having any link, Jeffries gave a small portion of the proceeds from the auction of the tusk to a multiple sclerosis charity, a cause with personal importance to Rowling.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/10419436/JK-Rowling-denies-finding-Harry-Potter-inspiration-on-narwhal-tusk.html JK Rowling denies finding Harry Potter inspiration on narwhal tusk - The Telegraph]</ref>
*A very early draft of J. K. Rowling's first ''Harry Potter'' novel – which is on display at the British Library's ''[[Harry Potter: A History of Magic]]'' exhibition – reveals that the author had originally depicted Fudge as a Muggle politician who met with the wizarding world's envoy, Rubeus Hagrid, to discuss a series of mysterious deaths and vanishings.
**In the original version, Hagrid attributed these deeds to a villain whom he refused to name and begged Fudge to warn the public about the mysterious threat. A stunned Fudge thought about the strange encounter for a while and then called a press conference to warn Muggles about a "little man with red eyes" and urged them to "be careful not to tell this little man where anyone lived".
**The Muggle version of Fudge also had a connection to [[Vernon Dursley]]. Vernon was originally one of the Muggle Minister's enemies, who Fudge feared would be after his job now that he was "clearly nuttier than a bag of salted peanuts". But rather than attempt to oust him, Mr Dursley actually came to chat with Fudge about the wizarding world and his nephew, who'd been placed in his care following the death of his parents.<ref>http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-10-27/harry-potters-cornelius-fudge-was-originally-a-muggle-minister/</ref>
**This draft can now be read in the book ''[[Harry Potter: A Journey Through a History of Magic]]''. It was later re-purposed for "The Other Minister", the first chapter of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''.
