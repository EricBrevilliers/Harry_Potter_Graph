'''Madam Z. Nettles''' was an [[England|English]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who lived in [[Topsham]].<ref name="COS8">{{COS|B|8}}</ref>

==Biography==
She was apparently a mediocre witch, and could not remember [[incantation]]s or brew [[potion]]s successfully. She took a [[Kwikspell]] course to improve her [[magic]]al skills. According to a testimonial she wrote for the company, the course helped her to improve her skills, as she became the centre of attention at parties and her friends and family begged her for the recipe of her [[Scintillation Solution]].<ref name="COS8">{{COS|B|8}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Potion]]s''': According to herself, the Kwikspell course helped her improve her potion-making ability, allowing her to brew the [[Scintillation Solution]] successfully.<ref name="COS8"/>
