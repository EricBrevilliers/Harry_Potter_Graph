{{Quote|We'll teach just those whose ancestry's purest.|Slytherin's opinion regarding the running of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
'''Salazar Slytherin''' (fl. c. [[First millennium A.D.|993]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], noted for his cunning and determination. He was regarded as one of the greatest wizards of the age, regarded for his abilities as a [[Parseltongue|Parselmouth]]<ref name="COS11"/> and as a skilled [[Legilimency|Legilimens]].<ref name="JKRS"/> Slytherin was one of the [[Hogwarts founders|four founders]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] along with [[Godric Gryffindor]], [[Helga Hufflepuff]], and [[Rowena Ravenclaw]]. He was also the namesake of [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]].<ref name="COS9"/>

He mistrusted [[Muggle-born]] students to the point of proposing that they should not be accepted at Hogwarts. When he expressed his opinion to the other Hogwarts founders, they did not agree with him. In response, he left the school, never to return, and constructed the [[Chamber of Secrets]] to house a [[Serpent of Slytherin|Basilisk]], so that one day, the [[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]] could purge the school of Muggle-borns in his name, and fulfil his long-lasting wish of having only students with at least one wizarding relative.<ref name="COS17"/>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Salazar Slytherin was raised into a [[pure-blood]] family in either [[England]] or [[Ireland]], where he was either born or raised in a [[fen]]-land area.<ref name="fen"/> He and his family had the rare [[magic]]al gift of speaking [[Parseltongue]], which led to his strong association with [[Snake|serpents]].<ref name="COS11"/>

At some point, Slytherin created his [[Salazar Slytherin's wand|own wand]], made of [[Snakewood]] with a core of [[Basilisk horn]]. He taught it the unique ability to "sleep" when commanded in [[parseltongue]].<ref name="PM-ilvermorny"/> Whilst obtaining the branch for his wand, he obtained another [[Snakewood tree branch|branch]], which he hid in [[Hogwarts Castle]], protected by a powerful [[Salazar Slytherin's curse|curse]]. Over the years a legend grew around this branch, due to the power of Slytherin's wand, and it became a cult relic for those who admired Slytherin's work.<ref name="HMHDSSFT">{{HM}}, Hogwarts Diary: Salazar Slytherin's Forgotten Treasure</ref>

===Hogwarts founder===
[[File:Salazar Slytherin WWHP.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Salazar Slytherin wearing his locket]]
Salazar Slytherin founded [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], with [[Godric Gryffindor]], [[Helga Hufflepuff]] and [[Rowena Ravenclaw]]. He appeared to have carefully selected the members of [[Slytherin|his own House]].<ref name="COS9"/>

The qualities which Slytherin prized in his "''handpicked students''" included resourcefulness, determination, and a certain disregard for the rules, along with the ability to speak [[Parseltongue]].<ref name="COS18">{{COS|B|18}}</ref> He also selected his students according to their cunning, ambition, and [[Blood status|blood purity]].<ref name="OOTP11">{{OOTP|B|11}}</ref> His house within Hogwarts was symbolised by a serpent,<ref name="COS11">{{COS|B|11}}</ref> with house colours of green and silver.<ref name="colours">{{HPcom|colours}}</ref>

As a [[professor]], he was in favour of [[Dark Arts (class)|teaching]] the [[Dark Arts]]. He sent one [[Salazar Slytherin's student|student]] on a task to study a [[relic|Dark relic]] in the nearby [[Feldcroft Catacomb]], which had the power to summon [[Inferius|Inferi]], which Slytherin recorded in his [[Slytherin's Spellbook|Spellbook]]. He also taught the [[Unforgivable Curses]], such as the [[Imperius Curse]], which were not illegal at the time.<ref name="HL-time">{{HL|In the Shadow of Time}}</ref>

He constructed a secret [[Slytherin's Scriptorium|Scriptorium]], which could only be accessed by those who spoke Parseltongue and had the willingness to cast the [[Cruciatus Curse]] on somebody else to enter. There, he kept his Spellbook, a tome that recorded his life and gave further insight into the Dark Arts. The secret of the Scriptorium passed through his descendants, the [[House of Gaunt]], for generations, until it was eventually opened by [[Ominis Gaunt]], along with [[Sebastian Sallow]] and their [[Unidentified 19th-century Hogwarts student|mutual friend]], in the [[1890–1891 school year]].<ref name="HL-study">{{HL|In the Shadow of the Study}}</ref>

Finally, and most famously, Salazar Slytherin was responsible for the construction of the [[Chamber of Secrets]] beneath the [[Dungeons]] of [[Hogwarts Castle]]. The Chamber contained a [[Serpent of Slytherin|Basilisk]] which could only be controlled by his own descendant, the "''Heir of Slytherin''", to be used to purge the school of all Muggle-borns.<ref name="COS13">{{COS|B|13}}</ref> In [[1943]], [[Tom Riddle]], the Heir of Slytherin, opened the Chamber and used the Basilisk to attack Muggle-borns, resulting in the [[death]] of [[Myrtle Warren]]. It was opened again in [[1992]], by [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] under the influence of [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|Tom Riddle's Diary]], which [[Horcrux|contained a fragment]] of his [[soul]].<ref name="COS17"/>

As time advanced, however, the Chamber turned into legend, as recounted by [[Professor]] [[Cuthbert Binns]] to his students one-thousand years later.<ref name="COS9"/>

===Leaving Hogwarts===
{{Quote|I fear we shall never come to an accord. I cannot persuade even one of them to listen to reason. I had dared hope that Godric's thoughts aligned with my own; that he understood why the calibre of students needed to be exceptional. But he has fallen prey to the ridiculous notion that Muggle-borns are somehow as capable as pure-bloods.|An excerpt from [[Slytherin's Diary]], in his own hand|Hogwarts Legacy}}
[[File:Chamber.png|250px|thumb|right|The statue of Salazar Slytherin and the hiding-place of Slytherin's Basilisk in the [[Chamber of Secrets]]]]
After founding Hogwarts and co-existing for years, a rift began to grow between Slytherin and the other founders. Slytherin disliked taking students from families with only [[Non-magic people|Muggles]], seeing them as untrustworthy and unworthy of being taught how to use their magic, and tried to persuade the other [[Hogwarts founders|founders]] to only take students from [[pure-blood]] or [[half-blood]] [[:Category:Pure-blood families|families]]. However, the other founders didn't agree with Slytherin, particularly [[Godric Gryffindor]].<ref name="COS9"/><ref name="HL-study"/>

Eventually, Slytherin and Gryffindor had a bitter argument over the subject. Slytherin chose to leave the school completely, but he had left the Chamber of Secrets and his Basilisk behind.<ref name="COS9"/>

===Post-mortem===
====Artistic representations====
There were [[portrait]]s of Slytherin hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]], one guarding a secret shortcut between the [[Dungeons|Dungeon]]'s antechamber and the [[Entrance Hall]] side room. The password required to gain access to said shortcut was ''Mortal Dread''.<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}} - PC version</ref> The other was hung at the [[Headmaster's office]], part of the [[Headmaster portraits]] gallery.<ref name="COSF">{{COS|F}} DVD (Disc 2 - Dumbledore's Office)</ref> Slytherin featured on various [[Chocolate Frog Cards]].<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref>

====Lord Voldemort====
[[File:COS carrying Myrtle's body away.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The death of Myrtle Warren]]
In [[1943]], [[Tom Riddle]], the "''Heir of Slytherin''", opened the [[Chamber of Secrets]] to conduct a purge on [[Muggle-born]] students.<ref name="COS17"/> This resulted in the [[death]] of [[Myrtle Warren]], who eventually returned as a [[ghost]].<ref name="COS16">{{COS|B|16}}</ref> Riddle opened the Chamber again in [[1993]] through the use of one of his seven [[Horcrux]]es, his [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|diary]]. Using the fragment of his [[soul]] within the diary, he [[Possession|possessed]] [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] and forced her to do his bidding. While he still attacked Muggle-born students (none of whom died, and were simply [[petrification|petrified]]), his ultimate goal was to lure Harry Potter into the Chamber and kill him.<ref name="COS17">{{COS|B|17}}</ref>

[[File:LocketDH.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Slytherin's Locket: one of the Horcruxes created by Lord Voldemort]]
Salazar Slytherin owned a locket emblazoned with the letter "''S''", which became an heirloom of his last known line of descendants, the [[House of Gaunt|Gaunts]]. [[Merope Riddle|Merope Gaunt]] sold the locket to [[Caractacus Burke]]. It was then bought up by [[Hepzibah Smith]], who had a love for antiques. It was subsequently stolen from her by [[Tom Riddle]], later known as Lord Voldemort.<ref name="HBP20">{{HBP|B|20}}</ref> Riddle would later turn the locket into a Horcrux<ref name="HBP23">{{HBP|B|23}}</ref> and conceal it in a [[The Cave|seaside cave]] he had visited in his youth.<ref name="HBP26">{{HBP|B|26}}</ref> The same locket was removed from the cave by [[Regulus Black]] with the aid of his [[house-elf]], [[Kreacher]]. Kreacher was ordered to destroy the locket, but was unable to do so.<ref name="DH10">{{DH|B|10}}</ref>

It was later stolen from the [[House of Black|Black family]] home at [[12 Grimmauld Place]] by [[Mundungus Fletcher]], and found its way into the hands of the Ministry of Magic bureaucrat, [[Dolores Umbridge]]. Umbridge claiming the "''S''" stood for [[Selwyn family|Selwyn]], a [[pure-blood]] family line. She either did not know better or intended to conceal its real meaning from the public.<ref name="DH13">{{DH|B|13}}</ref>
[[File:Locket destruction.gif|thumb|left|250px|The destruction of the Horcrux with Gryffindor's sword]]
The locket was recovered by [[Harry Potter]], and was later destroyed in the winter of [[1997]] by [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] with [[Sword of Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor's sword]]. This act of destruction removed all of the Horcrux's power.<ref name="DH19">{{DH|B|19}}</ref>

In [[1997]], Riddle, now known as Lord Voldemort, realised his ancestor's wish of purging the school of Muggle-borns by another method: by [[Fall of the British Ministry of Magic|taking over]] the [[British Ministry of Magic]] and using [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission|falsified propaganda]] to ostracise and eradicate Muggle-borns in the British wizarding population.<ref name="DH11">{{DH|B|11}}</ref> Voldemort managed to have Muggle-borns evicted from the wizarding world,<ref name="DH11"/><ref name="DH13"/> and at the end of the year, Voldemort even claimed that Hogwarts no longer needed [[Sorting Ceremony|sorting]], and that Slytherin's symbols, shields and colours would suffice. After [[Voldemort's Last Stand]], where he was defeated by [[Harry Potter]], all of this was repealed, and Slytherin's ultimate desire ended in failure.<ref name="DH36">{{DH|B|36}}</ref>

However, even after Voldemort's death, Salazar Slytherin's bloodline survived through Voldemort's secret daughter, [[Delphini]], whom he conceived with [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. As of [[2020]], Delphini was the last known survivor of the Slytherin bloodline.<ref name="CC">{{CC}}</ref>

====Theories====
While it is true that Slytherin constructed the Chamber,<ref name="HL-study"/> a popular historical theory mentioned on the [[Wizards' Ordinary Magic and Basic Aptitude Test]] was that towards the end of his life Salazar reconciled with the other founders and returned to the school, where he eventually died.<ref>[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/source/other-canon/jkr/jkr-w3/ WOMBAT Test 3] from {{JKRS}} (archived at [https://www.hp-lexicon.org/ The Harry Potter Lexicon])</ref>

==Physical description==
[[File:Salazar Slytherin (full size).gif|180px|thumb|Salazar Slytherin]]
{{Quote|Then, as Harry drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall... It was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard's sweeping stone robes, where two enormous grey feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor.|Description of the Statue of Slytherin|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
The statue of Salazar Slytherin in the [[Chamber of Secrets]] depicted an "''ancient and monkeyish''" man with a "''long thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of his sweeping robes''".<ref name="COS17"/> His beard was white in colour.<ref name="JKRS"/> [[Marvolo Gaunt]], a blood relative, was similarly described as being [[monkey]]-like in appearance.<ref name="HBP10">{{HBP|B|10}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
Salazar Slytherin was known to possess great cunning and determination, qualities which he prized in students of [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]].<ref name="OOTP11"/> At one point, the [[Sorting Hat]] referred to him as "''power-hungry Slytherin''".<ref name="GOF12">{{GOF|B|12}}</ref> He seemed to stop at nothing to get what he wanted, which was proven when he bred a [[Basilisk]] in the [[Chamber of Secrets]] to purge [[Muggle-born]]s from the school, despite the fact that the other founders disagreed with his beliefs.<ref name="COS9"/><ref name="HL-study"/> This ruthless and unscrupulous nature along with his [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood supremacist]] views would be adopted by numerous descendants of his, most infamously [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]].<ref name="COS17"/>

Slytherin was also quite proud and vain, as he went to the trouble of immortalising his image in the Chamber of Secrets in the form of a titanic statue standing several dozen feet tall, something that the other three founders were never known to have done.<ref name="COS17"/> An effigy of such proportions would certainly reflect a grandiose image of oneself.<ref name="COS17"/> This love of grandeur was apparently passed onto his bloodline as well, as the descending [[House of Gaunt|Gaunt bloodline]] ended up squandering their fortune for self-indulgent lavishness long before the generation of [[Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo]], who continued to flaunt the little heirlooms he had left in front of others.<ref name="HBP10"/>

Slytherin was said to be one of the greatest wizards of his age,<ref name="COS9"/> with extensive [[magic]]al abilities, particularly in [[Legilimency]].<ref name="JKRS"/> When considering [[Sorting Ceremony|sorting]] a student into Slytherin, the [[Sorting Hat]] looked for Slytherin's traits in the student, including cunning, determination, ambition, and resourcefulness.<ref name="COS18"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Quote|It matters, because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for. That's why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.|[[Hermione Granger]] informing [[Harry Potter]] of Slytherin's ability as a Parselmouth|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}

==Etymology==
According to [[J. K. Rowling]], Salazar Slytherin was named after the Portuguese dictator {{w|António de Oliveira Salazar}}, who ruled from 1932 to 1968.<ref>https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/852974465587847168</ref> The name ''Salazar'' means "old hall", from {{w|Castilian}} ''sala'' and {{w|Basque}} ''zahar''.<ref>{{Wikilink|Salazar (surname)}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:SalazarSlytherinLEGO.jpg|150px|thumb|Salazar Slytherin as a LEGO mini-figure]]
[[File:Salazar Slytherin.png|150px|thumb|Salazar Slytherin in {{LEGO|Y2}}]]
*Slytherin said he was "''only teaching those whose ancestry is purest''", not only those whose ancestry is "[[Pure-blood|completely spotless]]". As such, he did not view [[half-blood]] witches and wizards differently from [[Pure-blood|pure-bloods]] from a blood purity point of view, even if he considered them less respectable than pure-bloods, and thus Slytherin House let wizards such as [[Severus Snape]] and [[Tom Riddle]] into its ranks. It does mean, however, that he "usually" never allows [[Muggle-born]]s into his house.
*Slytherin was the featured "[[Wizard of the Month]]" for June 2007 on [[J. K. Rowling]]'s website, where he was profiled: "''One of the four celebrated Founders of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], Salazar Slytherin was one of the first recorded [[Parseltongue|Parselmouths]], an accomplished [[Legilimency|Legilimens]], and a notorious champion of [[pure-blood supremacy]]''".
*In {{COS|F}}, the statue of Salazar Slytherin only covers his head, compared to the book where it was full-body. It was revealed in ''[[Harry Potter Page to Screen: The Complete Filmmaking Journey|Page to Screen]]'' that the Chamber is flooded so that the rest of the statue below his head is submerged beneath the water.
*Both pictures of Slytherin in the [[Wizard of the Month]] and at the Famous Cards depict Slytherin with steepled fingers.
*Salazar Slytherin appears as a portrait in the "Forbidden Journey" ride at Universal Orlando, where he expresses his dislike for [[Harry Potter]] and [[Albus Dumbledore]]. He is also the only one of the four Founders to appear in behind the scenes footage of the ride. A DVD extra shows the actor being dressed up on set.
*Although it was briefly speculated in ''Chamber of Secrets'', Harry is not, in fact, a direct descendant of Salazar Slytherin, though he ''is'' a distant cousin of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], as both are descended from the [[Peverell family]].
*Slytherin built the Chamber of Secrets to allow his heir to purge the school of Muggle-borns. However, after the chamber's failure, Voldemort accomplished Slytherin's wishes with another method: by taking over the [[British Ministry of Magic]] and creating the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]] to purge Muggle-borns from the wider wizarding population.
**However, in a sense of irony, Salazar Slytherin's construction of the Chamber of Secrets would later prove to be one of the key factors in ending Lord Voldemort's reign, by default extincting the family in the male line. If not for the Chamber, Harry Potter would not have found out that Basilisk venom was capable of destroying Horcruxes and later used it to destroy two of Voldemort's, as well as giving the Sword of Gryffindor the ability to destroy three other Horcruxes after killing the Basilisk.
*Although it has been suggested that Salazar Slytherin was from the Fens in eastern [[England]], it has not been confirmed. It would also make sense if Slytherin came from [[Ireland]], as that would mean that the four founders of Hogwarts would have originated from the four main countries that make up a vast majority of Hogwarts students. [[Scotland]] ([[Rowena Ravenclaw]]), [[Wales]] ([[Helga Hufflepuff]]), England ([[Godric Gryffindor]]) and Ireland. However, Ireland does not have snakes, and it is unknown when and where Slytherin discovered his Parselmouth abilities. The Gaunt family, his descendants, have lived in both England and Ireland.
*He is played by actor [[Ken Bones]] in {{HPFJ}}.<ref name="imdb">[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0094297/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t1 Ken Bones's profile on IMDb]</ref>
*Since snakewood is not naturally found in what [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s call the Old World,<ref>{{Wikilink|Snakewood}}</ref> it is likely that Slytherin travelled to [[North America|North]] or [[South America]] or to [[Australia]] to acquire the wood for his wand, as [[wizardkind|wizards]] were aware of the New World long before Muggles.
*In [[2019]], a new species of pit viper discovered in {{W|Arunachal Pradesh}}, [[India]] was named ''{{W|Trimeresurus salazar}}'', after Salazar Slytherin.<ref>[https://zse.pensoft.net/article/48431/element/8/21033// A new species of green pit vipers of the genus Trimeresurus Lacépède, 1804 (Reptilia, Serpentes, Viperidae) from western Arunachal Pradesh, India]</ref>
*Although his only known descendant in [[2020]] was [[Delphini]], Salazar may have had descendants in [[United States of America|America]] via [[Martha Steward (II)|Martha Steward]].
**Martha, however, was a [[Squib]], and she married a [[Martha Steward (II)'s husband|Muggle]], so if there were descendants of hers in America, they most likely would be Muggle-born wizards, or Muggles. Ironically, Salazar Slytherin may therefore have had descendants who were in the two categories of people he hated most.
