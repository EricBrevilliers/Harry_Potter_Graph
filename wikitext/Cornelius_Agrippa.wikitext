==Behind the scenes==
*{{W|Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa|Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim}} ([[1486]]–[[1535]]) was a German soldier, physician and author whose major works include ''Declamatio de nobilitate et praecellentia foeminei sexus'' (''Declamation on the Nobility and Preeminence of the Female Sex''), a book first published in [[1529]] that asserts that women are morally and theologically superior to men, and ''{{W|De occulta philosophia libri tres}}'' (''Three Books on Occult Philosophy''), a trilogy of books covering a wide variety of occult topics first published between [[1531]] and [[1533]]. He was an adept in alchemy, astrology, and magic. His interest in the occult lead to criticism, and caused him to lose several jobs, but he is not known to have been imprisoned for it.<ref>{{Wikilink|Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa}}</ref>
