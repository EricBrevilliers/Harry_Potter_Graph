'''Professor Saul Croaker'''<ref name="PM" /> (fl. 1994) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and [[Unspeakable]] for the [[Department of Mysteries]], having spent his entire career studying [[time]]-[[magic]].<ref name="PM" />

==Biography==
[[Professor Croaker's law]] was named for him. Croaker attended the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]] final, either attending with or meeting fellow Unspeakable [[Broderick Bode]]. Croaker was among the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] employees that passed by the [[Weasley family]]'s campsite.<ref name="GOF7">{{GOF|B|7}}</ref>

==Etymology==
A ''"Croaker"'' is someone who habitually predicts evil; it has that sense because croaking is a noise made by [[crow]]s and [[raven]]s, who are considered [[death]] omens, as they are carrion eaters.
