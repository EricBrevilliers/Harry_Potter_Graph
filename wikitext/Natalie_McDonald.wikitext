==Behind the scenes==
*In real life, Natalie McDonald was a young [[Canada|Canadian]] fan of the novels with a terminal illness, {{W|leukaemia}}. A friend of her mother's wrote to [[J. K. Rowling]] to ask her to write to Natalie. J.K. Rowling did not receive the letter until after a holiday and, though she admitted to fearing it was "too late", wrote back, telling Natalie what would happen to each of the main characters, only to find out from Natalie's mother that she had passed away. The two women began a friendship, and Natalie was thus added to the books as a tribute, being [[Sorting Ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]], the [[Hogwarts Houses|House]] of bravery. Her mother kept the contents of the letter secret until her other two children finished reading {{DH}}.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20230606171934/http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1100-macleans-bethune.html ''Maclean's'' article] hosted on [http://www.accio-quote.org Accio Quote] (Archived)</ref>
