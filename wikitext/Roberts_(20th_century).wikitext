'''Mr Roberts''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] man who managed the [[Roberts's campsite|campsite]] near where the [[Quidditch World Cup]] was held in [[1994]]. He lived with his [[Roberts's wife|wife]] and [[Roberts children|two children]] in a [[Roberts family cottage|stone cottage]] at the front of the campground. His youngest child was a boy.<ref name="GOF7"/>

==Biography==
Mr Roberts believed that his [[Wizardkind|wizarding]] guests were confused with [[Muggle money]] because they were all from out of the country; [[Individuals who tried to pay Mr Roberts with Galleons|two]] even tried to pay him with a [[galleon]].<ref name="GOF7"/>

{{Quote|At that moment, a wizard in plus-fours appeared out of thin air next to Mr Roberts's front door. <nowiki>'</nowiki>''Obliviate!''<nowiki>'</nowiki> he said sharply, pointing his wand at Mr Roberts.|An [[Wizard in plus-fours|Obliviator]] apparating and obliviating Roberts|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] employees were required to perform [[Memory Charm]]s on him several times a day.<ref name="GOF7">{{GOF|B|7}}</ref>

[[Reappearance of the Dark Mark|The night after]] the [[Quidditch]] match, Mr Roberts, his wife, and their two children were all abducted by [[Death Eaters]], who proceeded to [[Dangling Jinx|levitate]] them through the air, and, like puppeteers controlling four [[marionette]]s with invisible strings, contorted the defenceless family into grotesque shapes and span them around mid-air as means to humiliate and frighten them.<ref name="GOF9">{{GOF|B|9}}</ref> When [[Arthur Weasley]] and his party were leaving the campsite the following morning, Mr Roberts wished them a Merry [[Christmas]], although it was the middle of summer. Mr Weasley explained that Mr Roberts had been left temporarily disoriented by the [[Memory Charm]] that had been used to erase his memories of the Death Eater attack.<ref name="GOF10">{{GOF|B|10}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*The Robertses did not make it to the final cut of {{GOF|FA}}. A brief shot of them being tortured by Death Eaters during the [[Reappearance of the Dark Mark|Quidditch World Cup riot]] can be seen, however, in the film's official trailer.
