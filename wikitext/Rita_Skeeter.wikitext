{{Quote|You horrible woman. You don't care, do you, anything for a story, and anyone will do, won't they?|[[Hermione Granger]] admonishing Rita's horrid personality|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
'''Rita Skeeter''' (b. [[1951]])<ref name="PM"/> was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and journalist who specialised in writing poison-pen stories. These stories tended to be based on false information and misreported interviews. She wrote articles as a [[Gossip Correspondent]] for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', as well as a few 'tell-all' biographies. She occasionally worked as a [[Quidditch commentator]] for [[Quidditch World Cup|World Cup]] games.<ref name="QC"/> Skeeter preferred writing for the sake of publicity and wrote what she thought people would "like to read" and what was lies rather than what they "ought to read" and which was the truth.

[[Albus Dumbledore]] in particular described her writing as "enchantingly nasty" after she wrote an unfavourable article about him.<ref name="GOF18"/>

Notable stories Rita covered included the trials of various [[Death Eaters]] after the [[First Wizarding War]], the [[Triwizard Tournament]], and (albeit reluctantly) [[Harry Potter]]'s account of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Return of Lord Voldemort|return to power]] in [[1995]] for ''[[The Quibbler]]''. She also wrote biographies of [[Armando Dippet]], Albus Dumbledore, [[Severus Snape]], and Harry Potter.

Rita's writing tended to be sensationalist and sometimes outright dishonest, paralleling her beliefs about writing what people "like to read". Her [[Rita Skeeter's biography of Harry Potter|biography]] of Harry Potter, for instance, was described as being only one-quarter factual, with the remaining three-quarters being pure fabrication and general dislike for Harry Potter being made into fake stories.<ref name="Harry bio">[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript 30 July, 2007 chat transcription] at The Leaky Cauldron</ref> Her ability to acquire information was assisted by her status as an unregistered [[beetle]] [[Animagus]].<ref name="GOF37"/>

==Biography==
===Early life {{C|1951–1970s}}===
Skeeter was born into a [[half-blood]] or [[pure-blood]] family<ref name="Blood"/> in [[1951]].<ref name="PM"/>

Skeeter attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in her youth. She held resentment towards [[Bilton Bilmes]] for a prank he pulled on her which prevented her joining the [[Slug Club]], which involved putting [[Bulbadox powder]] in [[Horace Slughorn]]'s [[tea]]. She had spent time currying favour with Slughorn and had gained acceptance to one of his parties, only for Bilmes' prank to end the meeting early and finish her chances of joining for good.<ref name="HM4SZ"/>

Skeeter spent time training to become an [[Animagus]] and, at some point prior to [[1986]], she was finally able to transform into a [[beetle]] at will. Skeeter aspired to be a journalist and an author, using this ability to spy and eavesdrop as a beetle for her articles.<ref name="PM"/>

===Career as a journalist/author {{C|1970s–1995}}===
====Early years====
[[File:Harry-potter-goblet-of-fire rita camera man.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Rita standing with her [[Bozo|camera man]] preparing for an interview]]
During her early days as an author, Skeeter wrote a biography on [[Armando Dippet]] entitled ''[[Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?]]''. Based on many of her later books, it was presumably also an exaggerated history of him to gain controversy and, by extension, popularity and fame. This book turned out to be a best-seller, with numerous copies sold. Sometime in her early career, Skeeter also provided a quote for the critical acclaim for {{QTA}} by [[Kennilworthy Whisp]], when she wrote "''I've read worse.''" as a review.

====First Wizarding War====
[[File:Rita at trail.jpg|250px|thumb|left|A younger Rita Skeeter as a court reporter at the trial of [[Igor Karkaroff]]]]
Skeeter was a journalist by the time of the [[First Wizarding War]] when [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] was in power. In [[1981]], after the fall of Voldemort and the end of the War, Skeeter reported on the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] trials before the [[Council of Magical Law]], including the trials of people such as [[Igor Karkaroff]] and [[Ludovic Bagman]].<ref name="GOF30">{{GOF|B|30}}</ref>
{{Clear}}

====Guest speaker at Hogwarts====
[[File:Rita Skeeter's Great Hall speech HM.png|250px|thumb|right|Rita Skeeter giving a speech to the students of Hogwarts in the [[Great Hall]]]]
Rita was a guest speaker at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] during the [[1986–1987 school year]]. Prior to the reveal, the identity of the speaker generated quite a buzz throughout the school, with [[Rowan Khanna]]'s guess being an [[Auror]], the [[Minister for Magic]], or a random [[Arithmancer]], while [[Jacob's sibling]] thought it to perhaps be [[Patricia Rakepick|the person]] [[Albus Dumbledore]] had been searching for throughout the school year. [[Professor]] [[Minerva McGonagall]] introduced her to the school in the [[Great Hall]], with Rita adding a bit more detail, stating herself to be "a widely popular writer for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''".<ref name="HM3WWF"/>

She then gave a speech about the general [[wizarding world]] being curious about the happenings within Hogwarts, as, [[Cursed Vaults]] aside, there apparently were talks about Hogwarts having the most promising assemblage of students in years, and that, in order to find out who the brightest student was, Professor Dumbledore had given the ''Prophet'' permission to observe and conduct a friendly competition, with the winner featuring on a front page article in the ''Prophet'' to start. Rita then observed [[Potions (class)|Potions]], [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]], [[Flying (class)|Flying]], and [[Charms (class)|Charms]] classes, much to most of the instructors' annoyance, before eventually forcing Jacob's sibling, who suspected that Rita knew something about the whereabouts of their [[Jacob (Hogwarts expellee)|missing brother]], to decide the winner of the competition.<ref name="HM3WWF">{{HM|3|Wizarding World Famous}}</ref>

====Book researcher====
[[File:Rita Skeeter speaking to Jacob's sibling HM.png|250px|thumb|left|Rita speaking with Jacob's sibling]]
Subsequent to her guest speaker role, during the [[1987–1988 school year]], Rita returned to Hogwarts to interview the staff as research for a book she was writing. She was particularly interested in uncovering Hogwarts's dark and dangerous secrets in the hopes her book would force the [[headmaster]], who she had a dislike for, to step down. Jacob's sibling was assigned as a chaperone while she interviewed [[Rubeus Hagrid]], [[Torvus]] the [[centaur]], and Professor [[Silvanus Kettleburn]] and inspected the [[Restricted Section]] of the [[Hogwarts Library]].<ref name="HM4RR"/>

Jacob's sibling reported her questions and motivations to Albus Dumbledore, who revealed to them that Rita was an unregistered Animagus who was using her abilities to eavesdrop at the time. Dumbledore convinced her to return to human form and they all came to an agreement to not expose Rita's abilities in exchange for her not publishing her book critical of Hogwarts.<ref name="HM4RR">{{HM|4|Rita Returns}}</ref>

====Denouncing Hogsmeade====
During the same school year, Rita scathingly reviewed the village of [[Hogsmeade]], saving most of her venom for [[Zonko's Joke Shop]], causing the village to lose business revenue and Bilmes to temporarily shut down Zonko's. When confronted by Bilmes and Jacob's sibling, she revealed it was due to her grudge against Bilmes for preventing her from joining the Slug Club. Bilmes got revenge on Skeeter by allowing her to drink a mug of [[Butterbeer]] containing [[Belch Powder]], much to Skeeter's further anger.<ref name="HM4SZ"/>

====Harassing Celestina Warbeck====
Skeeter travelled to Hogwarts again in the [[1988–1989 school year]] to interview the famous singer [[Celestina Warbeck]] about why she had returned to Hogwarts. Skeeter was present on the [[Hogsmeade station]] platform when Warbeck arrived. Warbeck disguised herself with a feather boa and Jacob's sibling escorted her away from the scene before Skeeter could spot her.<ref name="HM5CNG"/>

[[File:Rita Skeeter being scared away with frogs HM.png|250px|thumb|right|Rita Skeeter opening a cupboard full of frogs]]
Skeeter later harassed Warbeck for information about why she was at Hogwarts in her dressing room on the [[Hogwarts Quidditch pitch]], which she refused to divulge to her, so Skeeter told her she would instead have to fabricate quotes by simply reading her face. Jacob's sibling and [[Tulip Karasu]] thought that, in order to get rid of her so they could [[Anapneo|unblock]] Warbeck's blocked throat, they would spook her with [[frog]]s spawned with [[Frog Spawn Soap]], as Tulip heard frogs made her uneasy. Jacob's sibling told her a student was trapped in a locker, which Rita believed, thinking it would make a good story, and she opened it, being showered with frogs, causing her to flee in horror.<ref name="HM5CNG">{{HM|5|CELESTINA's NEW GROOVE}}</ref>

====International Confederation of Wizard's Conference====
Rita covered the [[International Confederation of Wizards' Conference]] during the summer of [[1994]], describing [[Albus Dumbledore]] as an "obsolete dingbat".<ref name="GOF18">{{GOF|B|18}}</ref>

====1994 Quidditch World Cup====

[[File:B4C8M1 cropped 1994 Quidditch World Cup WW.jpg|250px|thumb|left|1994 Quidditch World Cup]]
Following the [[Reappearance of the Dark Mark]] after the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]], Skeeter penned a scathing report of the [[British Ministry of Magic]]'s handling of the riots, accusing the Ministry of incompetence over their failure to catch any of the [[Death Eaters|culprits]]. 

These articles particularly angered [[Arthur Weasley]] for her obviously biased reporting, and he, along with his son and fellow Ministry employee [[Percy Weasley]], had to head to the Ministry to help sort out the controversy, as she had mentioned Arthur in her article.<ref name="GOF10">{{GOF|B|10}}</ref>

====Triwizard Tournament====
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Harry Potter|I didn't. I don’t know how my name got into the Goblet of Fire. I didn’t put it in there.|Rita|Come now, Harry, there’s no need to be scared of getting into trouble.

Nervous?|Rita Skeeter interviewing Harry Potter|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:B4C18M2 Rita Skeeter interviews Harry.png|250px|thumb|Rita interviewing [[Harry Potter]]]]
That year, Rita was given the opportunity to interview the [[Triwizard Tournament]] contestants for an article in the ''Daily Prophet''. Under the guise of interviewing all four champions, she confronted [[Harry Potter]] in a broom cupboard where she took his "um"s and "er"s and used them as material to make her own quotes where Harry had said them. Eventually, her "interview of the contestants" turned out to be a highly falsified story of Harry himself.<ref name="GOF18">{{GOF|B|18}}</ref>

The article's falseness painted Harry as a tragic hero who cried himself to sleep over his [[Potter family|late parents]] and who had a romantic relationship with [[Hermione Granger]]. The article was mostly taken negatively by Harry's schoolmates, who assumed he was craving attention, although [[Molly Weasley]] seemed to take it very seriously, to the point that she was particularly cool towards Hermione for a time until Harry assured her that the article was lying and he and Hermione had never dated. At some point after the first task, Albus Dumbledore banned Rita from entering [[Hogwarts Castle]].<ref name="GOF21">{{GOF|B|21}}</ref>

====Interviewing Hagrid====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Rita Skeeter|What are these fascinating creatures called?|Rubeus Hagrid|Blast-Ended Skrewts.|Really? I’ve never heard of them before... where do they come from?|Rita Skeeter interviewing Hagrid about his strange creatures|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}} 
[[File:B4C21M1 cropped Rita Skeeter watching Care of Magical Creatures PM.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Rita watching a [[Care of Magical Creatures]] lesson focused on Blast-Ended Skrewts]]
Rita then interviewed [[Rubeus Hagrid]], asking many questions about Harry that Hagrid refused to answer.<ref name="GOF21">{{GOF|B|21}}</ref> Her subsequent article described Hagrid as a ferocious-looking man who used his authority to terrify his students, but this interview's quote information was otherwise mostly true and unchanged. The article also revealed to the world that Hagrid was actually [[half-giant]], which prompted letters from parents frightened by the idea of having a dangerous [[giant]] teaching their children and greatly upset Hagrid, subjecting him to ridicule and fear. 

However, his mood was rallied when Harry, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], Hermione, and Dumbledore visited him and assured him that they didn't care about [[Hagrid family|his family]] being the vicious monsters everyone believed them to be. Giants really were vicious and brutal, but Hagrid obviously wasn't, so Professor Dumbledore insisted Hagrid deny any insults and return to work, as Harry and his friends didn't care about Hagrid's family due to their knowledge of him as a person.<ref name="GOF24">{{GOF|B|24}}</ref>

Harry, Ron, and Hermione later overheard Rita discussing the possibility of writing an embarrassing story about [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]], Head of the [[Department of Magical Games and Sports]].

[[File:Tumblr mrtmk4u7no1r1d9g4o7 r1 250.gif|250px|thumb|''HARRY POTTER'S SECRET HEARTACHE'', published in ''[[Witch Weekly]]'' by Rita]]
When Rita encountered Harry, Ron, and Hermione in [[Hogsmeade]], Hermione insulted her for her libel. Rita, in retaliation, then wrote a nasty story about the "''devious Miss Granger''" based on false rumours provided by [[Pansy Parkinson]], making her out to be a plain but skilled witch who used [[Love Potion|love potions]] to satisfy her ''"taste for famous wizards''". Rita implied that Hermione was toying with the affections of both Harry and [[Viktor Krum]].<ref name="GOF27">{{GOF|B|27}}</ref> Although Hermione was more disdainful than upset about the article, she unfortunately started receiving [[Witch Weekly readers' hate mail to Hermione Granger|angry mail]] from people who believed Rita's lies. Some of the hate mail even came with [[jinx]]es and [[curse]]s.<ref name="GOF28">{{GOF|B|28}}</ref> Even Molly Weasley was upset with Hermione until Harry set her straight.<ref name="GOF18"/>

[[File:Harry-potter-goblet-rita, harry, and hermione.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Rita with Harry Potter and Hermione Granger in the tent during the first task]]
Rita's last defaming article stated that Harry was "''disturbed and dangerous''" and used comments from [[Draco Malfoy]] and his fellow [[Slytherin]] best friends as its basis.<ref name="GOF31">{{GOF|B|31}}</ref> Ultimately, Hermione discovered the means by which Rita spied on others and forced her to "''keep her quill to herself for a full year''" by catching her in her beetle form while she was perched on the [[Hospital Wing]] window and trapping her in a jar imbued with an [[Unbreakable Charm]] so she couldn't transform. 

Hermione blackmailed Rita by threatening to report her to the authorities at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] as an unregistered [[Animagus]], which would have severe legal consequences. Rita was forced to comply, suffering financial strain as a result.<ref name="GOF37">{{GOF|B|37}}</ref> Unfortunately, her last article would discredit Harry and serve as the basis for [[Minister for Magic]] [[Cornelius Fudge]] to refuse to believe Harry's story about [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort's]] return, starting the Ministry's [[Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter|smear campaign]] against both Harry and Dumbledore.

====''The Quibbler''====

[[File:Marygrandpre harry interview.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Rita Skeeter interviewing Harry Potter in the Three Broomsticks Inn]]
In [[1995]], Harry Potter's story that Lord Voldemort had [[Return of Lord Voldemort|returned]] was not believed by much of the [[wizarding world]]. Articles about his claims in the ''Daily Prophet'' portrayed him as either a delusional boy or an attention-seeking liar. Hermione Granger wanted to get the truth to the public and thus instructed Rita to meet her and [[Luna Lovegood]] in [[Hogsmeade]] on [[14 February]] [[1996]] in the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]]. As it was Rita who laid the foundation for the ''Prophet's'' defamation of Harry with her initial stories about him, Hermione wanted her to also be the one to set the record straight. They were joined by Harry after his date with [[Cho Chang]]. Harry thought that Hermione and Rita were "''the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates he could ever have imagined''".<ref name="OP25"/>

Rita was initially taken aback that Hermione wanted her to interview Harry, but then became resentful, since Hermione demanded that she only write exactly what Harry said and not portray him in a negative way. Rita claimed the ''Prophet'' would not buy the story, reluctantly admitting that the Ministry of Magic was influencing it. Hermione told her that the interview would be printed in ''[[The Quibbler]]'', which [[Xenophilius Lovegood|Luna's father]] edited. Although Rita responded with disdain, she "eyed Hermione shrewdly" for a few moments and then agreed. However, when she learned she was expected to conduct the interview free of charge, she was furious. Because Hermione was able to blackmail Rita with the threat of reporting her unregistered Animagus status to the Ministry, Rita grudgingly complied and wrote the article.<ref name="OP25">{{OOTP|B|25}}</ref>

The interview was subsequently printed in ''The Quibbler'', becoming its best-selling issue of all time. It was banned at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] by [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor|High Inquisitor]] [[Dolores Umbridge]], which seemed to only increase its popularity.<ref name="OP26">{{OOTP|B|26}}</ref> Editor [[Xenophilius Lovegood]] sold the article to the ''Prophet'' after the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], during which Voldemort's return became public, and he and his daughter Luna used the money to travel to [[Sweden]] in search of the [[Crumple-Horned Snorkack]].<ref name="OP38">{{OOTP|B|38}}</ref>

===''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore'' {{C|1997}}===
{{Quote|Harry next recognised Rita Skeeter, who, he was infuriated to see, had a notebook clutched in her red-taloned hand.|Rita makes an appearance at Dumbledore's funeral|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:B6C30M1 funeral of Albus Dumbledore.png|250px|thumb|left|Rita was present at the funeral of Albus Dumbledore]]
Rita made a brief appearance at Hogwarts at the end of the [[1996–1997 school year]], where Harry was infuriated to notice her clutching a notebook at [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's funeral]] in [[June]] [[1997]].<ref name="HBP30">{{HBP|B|30}}</ref> It was, perhaps, her being present at the funeral that prompted her to write a biography of Albus Dumbledore, as within four weeks, she wrote a 900-page biography about him, ''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]]'', which also included authentic old photos of the famed Hogwarts headmaster. Rita was interviewed by [[Betty Braithwaite]], a fellow ''Daily Prophet'' reporter, in her [[Rita Skeeter's home|home]], whom she treated very warmly, serving her tea and [[Pound cake]] and informing her of much gossip surrounding the book's release.<ref name="DH2">{{DH|B|2}}</ref>

[[File:RitaSkeeterBookSigning.png|250px|thumb|right|Rita promoting her new book]]
The book depicted the former headmaster in an extremely negative light, but was mostly based on truth, much to Harry's horror. It was implied that she got some of her information in unethical or illegal ways, as much of the book's content was obtained through an interview Rita conducted with [[Bathilda Bagshot]], a very elderly historian, where Skeeter used [[Veritaserum]] to gain information about Dumbledore's childhood. Skeeter stole photographs from Bagshot as well. The subsequent novel sensationalised everything, implying that Dumbledore had dabbled in the [[Dark Arts]] and contributed to the death of [[Ariana Dumbledore|his sister]].<ref name="DH18">{{DH|B|18}}</ref>

It turned out that Rita got at least some of her facts straight for once, but had no idea of the true story behind certain fabrications, such as her claiming that [[Ariana Dumbledore]] was a [[Squib]]<ref name="DH18"/> and that her mother was ashamed of her, when, in reality, she suffered from [[Obscurus|uncontrollable bursts of magic]] due to a highly traumatic experience when she was around six.<ref name="DH28">{{DH|B|28}}</ref>

===Later life {{C|1997–2019}}===
{{Quote|Naturally, what could stop Rita ''[from still reporting]''? I imagine she immediately dashed off a biography of Harry after he defeated Voldemort. One quarter truth to three quarters rubbish.|[[J. K. Rowling]] regarding Rita's later life}}
Following [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort's]] death, Skeeter wrote a [[Rita Skeeter's biography of Harry Potter|biography]] of [[Harry Potter]] that was known for being only about one-quarter true, as well as one about [[Severus Snape]] titled ''[[Snape: Scoundrel or Saint?]]''.<ref name="live-chat">[http://www.bloomsbury.com/harrypotter/content.asp?sec=3&sec2=1 30 July, 2007 chat transcription] at Bloomsbury site</ref> The latter added to her series of hatchet jobs on former [[Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Headmasters]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], along with ''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]]'' and ''[[Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?]]''

[[File:Linderina Crane and Rita Skeeter MA.png|250px|thumb|left|Linderina Crane and Rita Skeeter at Hogwarts]]
Skeeter visited Hogwarts with [[Linderina Crane]] during the [[2010–2011 school year]] and attempted to interview [[Daniel Page]], but gave up when he didn't feel like divulging anything. However, this didn't stop her from writing an [[Daily Prophet articles#HOGWARTS HOOLIGAN! SON OF NOTORIOUS BLOODY PAGES|article]] that exposed the criminal identity of [[Page family|Daniel's family members]]. She also wrote about Crane's failure to capture [[Nocturnal Order of Tricks and Magical Exhibitions|NOTME]], which put an end to her investigations and might have even cost her her career at the Ministry.<ref name="MA">{{MA}}</ref>

In the same school year, following the employment and sacking of Professor [[Elspeth MacGillony]], Skeeter wrote about the incident and voiced her concern of the continued employment of controversial teachers, claiming that it was not unlike when [[Albus Dumbledore]] was Headmaster.<ref name="MacGillony">{{MA}} {{See image 2|File:Rita Skeeter's report about Elspeth MacGillony 1 MA.jpg|File:Rita Skeeter's report about Elspeth MacGillony 2 MA.jpg}}</ref>

In [[April]] [[2014]], just before the opening matches of the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup|427th Quidditch World Cup]], [[Brazil|Brazilian]] manager [[José Barboza]] called the [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Chaser]]s "''talentless [[hag]]s''" over drinks with Rita Skeeter. These remarks became public, and Welsh manager [[Gwenog Jones]] promptly threatened to "''[[curse]]'' [his] ''face off''".<ref name="bra-v-wal">{{PM}} - [[BRAZIL VERSUS WALES]] (Archived)</ref><ref name="PM-QWC">{{PM}} - [[Quidditch World Cup 1990 - 2014]] (Archived)</ref> This created great tension between Jones and Barboza, culminating in a brawl between the two following the [[Brazilian National Quidditch team|Brazil]] vs. [[Welsh National Quidditch team|Wales]] match of the quarter-finals on [[4 June]]. Gwenog Jones attempted to keep her promise to curse off Barboza's face in full view of the packed stadium. The Welsh manager was dragged from the pitch by her own [[Beater]]s, and was later put in custody, and the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' later reported that [[Healer]]s confirmed Barboza's skin had almost regrown.<ref name="bra-v-wal"/>

[[File:Rita quill.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Rita standing with her infamous acid green quill]]
Rita Skeeter wrote a gossip column in ''The Daily Prophet'' about the Quidditch World Cup on [[8 July]], [[2014]], in which she mentioned that she was about to publish a new book about [[Dumbledore's Army]] on [[31 July]] called ''[[Dumbledore's Army: The Dark Side of the Demob]]''.

Rita Skeeter reported live from the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup final|final of the 2014 Quidditch World Cup]] in the [[Patagonian Desert]], on [[11 July]] 2014. Instead of focusing on the players, she spent the match spying on VIP Box Two in which the most prominent members of Dumbledore's Army were watching the game. [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Potter]], with Rita at the journalists' enclosure, repeatedly made corrections to her reports, until, shortly after the match ended, Rita remarked that her husband, Harry Potter, was "''publicity-hungry''" just as Ginny was approaching, Rita was taken "unaccountably ill" with what some called "''a [[jinx]] to the solar plexus''".<ref name="the-qwc2014-final">{{PM}} - [[2014 Quidditch World Cup final]] (Archived)</ref>

In [[2017]], Rita published a new book: ''[[Man or Monster? The TRUTH about Newt Scamander]]''. Like the rest of her books, most of it was rubbish — one claim even stated that [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] broke [[President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America|President]] [[Seraphina Picquery]]'s heart in [[1926]], something which he revealed was untrue in [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them|his own book]].

In [[September]] [[2019]], Rita met with a [[Calamity Investigator]] working for the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] during their attempt to address a [[Calamity]] surge focused on [[dragon]]s in [[White River State Park]]. After having a photo taken of the Calamity Investigator to make them look "suitably heroic", Rita demanded that the investigator prove their "relatability" by "mingling with the little people" for the benefit of her audience. Rita eventually published an article on the events at White River State Park and the Calamity Investigator's involvement in them.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>

[[File:RitaSkeeterPromo.JPG|200px|thumb|left|Rita Skeeter]]
Skeeter was described as having blonde hair set in elaborate curls that contrasted oddly with her heavy-jawed face. She wore jewelled spectacles studded with rhinestones and had thick fingers ending in two-inch nails, painted crimson. Her blonde curls were curiously rigid, suggesting they were styled with the magical equivalent of hairspray. In addition, she had pencilled-on eyebrows and three gold teeth, as well as large, masculine hands. Her bright scarlet painted fingernails and toenails were usually likened to claws or talons.

She was known to carry with her a [[crocodile]]-skin handbag, inside of which she carried her acid green [[Quick-Quotes Quill]]. She usually wore magenta-coloured robes, but also wore clothes of green leather with maroon furs at the collar and sleeves.<ref name="GOF18"/>

Apparently, unemployment did not serve Rita well, as, when she showed up during the [[1996|year]] she was blackmailed by Hermione not to write, Rita's nails were chipped, she was missing fake stones in her glasses, and her hair was lank and unkempt.<ref name="OP25"/> In her unregistered [[Animagus]] [[beetle]] form, her antennas were curled to resemble the curls in her hair and she had markings around her antennas resembling her jewelled glasses.<ref name="GOF37"/>

{{Quote|Rita Skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble, Amos! I would have thought you'd know that, working at the Ministry!|[[Molly Weasley]] remarking on Rita's tendency to exaggerate|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
Rita was an unregistered [[Animagus]], taking the form of a [[beetle]], and was able to slip around undetected and spy on unsuspecting company so she could obtain gossip for her articles, which she later exaggerated and exploited to gain the attention of the masses. Her ability to turn into a beetle also reflected how irritating and bothersome she was to other people, particularly [[Harry Potter]] and [[Albus Dumbledore]], and it also displayed her dishonest and cunning characteristics. Rita also wrote primarily for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', though some of her articles also appeared in other sources, such as ''[[Witch Weekly]]'' and ''[[The Quibbler]]''. Skeeter worked closely alongside [[Bozo]], her photographer.<ref name="GOF18">{{GOF|B|18}}</ref>

{{Quote|You don't want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter. I'm serious, [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], she'll dig up something on you —|Rita and her tendency for revenge|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Harry-potter-goblet-of-fire_rita1.jpg|250px|thumb|Rita getting the latest scoop]]
Rita was extremely nosy and willing to do anything for a good story — from spying on people in her [[Animagus]] form to sensationalising or outright inventing stories. She also took advantage of the elderly [[Bathilda Bagshot]]'s possibly fragile state of mind (even giving her [[Veritaserum]])<ref name="DH18"/> in order to dig up dirt on the late [[Albus Dumbledore]] for her extremely critical [[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore|biography]]. She did this despite the use of such a powerful truth serum being heavily controlled by the Ministry. Rita tended to portray the people she wrote about poorly, presumably because it sold more stories.

{{Quote|I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry before we start? The youngest champion, you know... to add a bit of colour?|Rita Skeeter requesting she interview Harry Potter, showing her desire to create interesting stories|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
However, she could also be very vindictive and spiteful towards those she disliked. For example, after [[Hermione Granger]] insulted her, Rita printed a completely false story about Hermione using [[Love Potion|love potions]] to toy with the hearts of both [[Harry Potter]] and [[Viktor Krum]]. This resulted in Hermione receiving [[Witch Weekly readers' hate mail to Hermione Granger|hate mail]], but she eventually got her revenge and blackmailed Rita into refraining from writing for a year. After this time period was up, Rita returned to her writing with as much gusto and as few scruples as before.

Rita also appeared to be highly prejudiced against [[half-giant]]s and wizards who spoke [[Parseltongue]]. She had no qualms in writing a hurtful and slanderous [[DUMBLEDORE'S GIANT MISTAKE|article]] about [[Rubeus Hagrid]] just because he was a half-giant,<ref name="GOF24"/> and another similarly slanderous [[HARRY POTTER "DISTURBED AND DANGEROUS"|article]] about Harry just because of his ability to speak Parseltongue, even though he was not a [[Dark wizard]].<ref name="GOF31"/> Rita seemed to take great pleasure in writing malicious articles about those she wished to slander and ridicule.

Despite her inaccuracies and biased articles, Rita seemed to be a fast writer and researcher, as she managed to finish a nine-hundred-page book in four weeks.

Rita seemed to have a somewhat low opinion of the intelligence of her average reader based on her style of reporting. In a previous article, she once referred to Hermione Granger as being "''stunningly pretty''", only to then describe her in an [[HARRY POTTER'S SECRET HEARTACHE|article]] published just a few months later as "''a plain, but ambitious girl''". She also stated regarding the ''Daily Prophet'' that it "''exists to sell itself''".

While she had a huge disregard for her interviewees' reputations and journalistic integrity, Rita deeply feared her own status as an unregistered Animagus being revealed to the world. She gave up a year's worth of article writing when blackmailed by Hermione Granger (her main means of making a living), as she knew the alternate consequences would be a sentence in [[Azkaban]]. However, while Hermione thought this one year of abstinence would curb Skeeter's ill-habit of writing hurtful articles, she was wrong, as once the deal has reached its end, she swiftly and shamelessly returned to her old ways of writing sensationalist and dishonest articles.

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Quote|No, you see... Rita Skeeter — is an unregistered Animagus. She can turn — into a beetle.|[[Hermione Granger]] exposing Rita's abilities as an Animagus|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:GF 37.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Rita's Animagus form]]
*'''[[Animagus]]''': Rita had mastered an incredibly complex branch of [[Transfiguration]], becoming an unregistered beetle [[Animagus]]. She did this to get information and gossip without being detected.<ref name="GOF37"/> However, Dumbledore caught her when she, in her Animagus form, was eavesdropping on Dumbledore and [[Jacob's sibling]]'s conversation.<ref name="HM4RR"/>
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Being an unregistered Animagus, she would have needed to have successfully brewed an [[Animagus potion]] in order to gain the ability to transform, a highly advanced and complex potion which required a high level of skill to concoct correctly.<ref name="MM">{{PP|H}}, Chapter 1 (''Minerva McGonagall'')</ref> Rita was also likely capable of brewing [[Veritaserum]], which she once used on [[Bathilda Bagshot]].<ref name="DH2"/>
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Rita had the ability to conjure at least a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]],<ref name="LEGOY1"/><ref name="LEGOY2"/> a highly advanced and powerful protective charm and a mark of superior magical skill. She could also effortlessly cast simple charms, such as the [[Fire-Making Spell]] and [[Levitation Charm]], which she also could cast non-verbally.<ref name="GOF18"/>
{{Quote|She unsnapped her crocodile-skin handbag and pulled out a handful of candles, which she lit with a wave of her wand and magicked into midair, so that they could see what they were doing.|Rita using non-verbal magic|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal magic]]''': Skeeter [[Fire-Making Spell|lit]] several [[candle]]s from her handbag and [[Levitation Charm|levitated]] them into the air, without saying the incantation.<ref name="GOF18"/> This implies she was a powerful witch, given the difficulty of casting nonverbal [[spell]]s. Dumbledore acknowledged her skills in nonverbal magic as 'ironic' given her irritatingly talkative personality.<ref name="HM4RR"/>
*'''Journalistic skills''': As one of the main editors for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', she was a very talented journalist and had years of experience in the field, having taken part in assessing the Death Eater trials after the first Wizarding War ended.<ref name="GOF30"/> Her primary work, ''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]]'', was mostly based on true information, much to the disdain of many, such as Harry Potter,<ref name="DH18"/> showing her to be a skilled researcher and writer as well.

==Relationships==
===Harry Potter===
{{Dialogue|Rita Skeeter|Congratulations, Harry! I wonder if you could give me a quick word? How you felt facing that dragon? How do you feel now about the fairness of the scoring?|Harry Potter|Yeah, you can have a word. Goodbye.|Rita trying to get an interview with [[Harry Potter]] after defeating a dragon in the First Task|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Harry Potter movies hbp promostills 6.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Harry Potter]], whom she publicly shamed]]
Rita Skeeter first met Harry Potter in [[1994]] when [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] was housing the [[Triwizard Tournament]], during which Harry's name shot surprisingly from the [[Goblet of Fire]]. She immediately tried to get an interview with Harry, but did not get the chance until the the [[Wand weighing ceremony|Weighing of the Wands]], which she did inside a small broom cupboard. After the interview, she dedicated a whole page of the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' for his interview, which greatly annoyed [[Amos Diggory]], the father of [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]], another Hogwarts champion.

Shortly before the [[Dragon Challenge|First Task]], she tried to get another interview, but was interrupted by [[Viktor Krum]] and [[Hermione Granger]] and was told to leave. Skeeter ended up getting her revenge on Hermione several times after this in ''[[Witch Weekly]]'' and the ''Daily Prophet''. After Harry defeated the [[Hungarian Horntail]] and retrieved his [[Golden egg|egg]], Rita tried to get another interview, to which Harry refused. Harry did not see Rita Skeeter again until the next year, where he gave her an interview for ''[[The Quibbler]]'' announcing the return of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]], which she did bitterly.

===Hermione Granger===
{{Dialogue a-b|Rita Skeeter|I'm supposed to do this ''for free''?|Hermione Granger|Well yes. Otherwise as you very well know, I will inform the authorities that you are an unregistered Animagus. Of course, the ''Prophet'' might give you rather a lot for an insider's account of life in [[Azkaban]]|Hermione forcing Rita to do an interview of Harry Potter about the return of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Hermione Granger Half Blood Prince.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Hermione Granger]], whom she disliked and publicly shamed]]
Rita Skeeter clashed with Hermione several times during both the Triwizard Tournament and during the denial of Lord Voldemort's return. She publicly shamed Hermione for her relationship with Viktor Krum and her supposed relationship with Harry Potter. When Hermione confronted and insulted Rita for having written horrible untruths about her friends, Rita vindictively responded by writing an article that painted Hermione as a "scarlet woman" who used her intellect and charm to toy with the affections of famous wizards. This caused Hermione to receive a large amount of [[Witch Weekly readers' hate mail to Hermione Granger|hate mail]], at least two of which were intended to cause significant harm to her, and be treated coldly by [[Molly Weasley]], who otherwise was very nice to her.

In return, Hermione furiously vowed to get revenge on Rita if it was the last thing she ever did. After researching for half a year about how Rita could possibly be getting her information despite being nowhere near and an unintentionally helpful hint from Harry, Hermione deduced that she was an unregistered Animagus and blackmailed her into keeping quiet for a whole year under threat of being exposed, which would otherwise land her in severe trouble.<ref name="GOF37"/> Hermione used this as leverage to get Rita to do an interview with Harry for ''The Quibbler'' without any charge. She called Hermione "Miss Prissy" and "Little Miss Perfect" due to her dislike of her.<ref name="OP25"/>

After the death of [[Albus Dumbledore]], Rita made her own biography about him called ''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]]'', which infuriated Hermione further.<ref name="DH18"/>

===Bathilda Bagshot===
[[File:Bathilda Bagshot profile.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Bathilda Bagshot]]]]
{{Quote|Dear Batty, Thanks for your help. Here's a copy of the book; hope you like it. You said everything, even if you don't remember it. Rita.|Rita Skeeter's note to Bathilda|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
In [[1997]], Rita Skeeter travelled to [[Godric's Hollow]] to meet Bagshot and used [[Veritaserum]] to get vital information for her book on Albus Dumbledore. After this interview, she left Bagshot a small note and her own copy of ''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore'', which was later taken by Hermione Granger and Harry Potter.<ref name="DH18"/> It is unknown whether Harry or Hermione kept the book, though it is unlikely that they did.

==Etymology==
*''{{W|Rita}}'' is a short form of the name ''Margarita'',<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/rita Behind the Name: Rita]</ref> a Latinate form of the name ''Margaret''. The name is derived from the Greek μαργαρίτης, ''margarites'', meaning "pearl."<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/margaret Behind the Name: Margaret]</ref>
*''Skeeter'' is a slang term for a "mosquito". This could be a reference to her [[Animagus]] form, which is an insect, her irritating personality, or to her career in tabloid journalism. The word ''paparazzi'' is derived from an Italian word for "mosquito".<ref>{{Wikilink|Paparazzi}}</ref> "Skeet" is also an Anglo-Manx colloquialism for gossip or an act of nosiness.<ref>{{Wikilink|Manx_English#Manx_loanwords|Manx loanwords}}</ref> Skeeter could also be a pun off of how annoying Skeeter's lies tend to be, as people tend to find mosquitoes annoying and attempt to swat them away.
*The character is similar to the "poison pen" biographer {{W|Kitty Kelley}}. Both have a semi-rhyming name with an animal reference and each is known for writing scandalous unauthorised biographies that largely consist of publishing every available unsubstantiated rumour about an individual. There is an interesting similarity in phrases used to describe the two authors. Skeeter was called "enchantingly nasty" by [[Albus Dumbledore]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]]'', and Kelley was called "encyclopedically vicious", by the [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6179623.stm ''New York Times''] while reviewing her biography of [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6179623.stm Nancy Reagan].

[[File:RitaSkeeter WB F4 RitaSkeeterCharacterIllustration V2 Illust 080615 Port.jpg|150px|thumb|Rita as she appears on {{PM}}]]
*According to Skeeter herself, the [[British Ministry of Magic]] told her exactly 514 times that it did not comment on the top-secret work of the [[British Auror Office]].<ref name="DA_QWC"/> Whether this is just under [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] or throughout Skeeter's entire career is unknown.
*Rita may have been a classmate of [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], as both witches were born in [[1951]], as well as [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Molly Weasley]], who were a year ahead of her. But, even if they both went to Hogwarts, it cannot be guaranteed they were in the same year because of their unspecified birth months. 
*During an interview on BBC Radio 4, [[J. K. Rowling]] admitted that Rita was originally called Bridget and appeared in the first draft of {{PS}}, trying to interview [[Harry Potter]] in the [[Leaky Cauldron]] on [[Harry Potter's eleventh birthday|his 11th birthday]]. She later cut the character from the final draft, wanting Rita to appear in Harry's fourth year, just when his fame started to oppress him.<ref name="desertisland">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/e0ee3d65#p00949j1 Desert Island Discs Podcast]</ref><ref name="Accio Quote">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004/0804-ebf.htm "J.K.Rowling at the Edinburgh Book Festival (15/08/2004)"] at [http://www.accio-quote.org/index.html Accio Quote]</ref>
*In the German audiobooks, Rita speaks with an American accent.
*Rita's tendency to write sensationalised and untrue stories about high profile members of the wizarding community is similar to (and may be a direct parody of) tabloid magazines stirring up stories about celebrities, politicians, and the economic elite. This can be seen in her shock-jock style of writing and purposeful misrepresentation of people's character in order to garner readership that prove to be consistently untrue and slanderous, with her interview with Harry about [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort's]] [[Return of Lord Voldemort|return]] being the only verified and totally accurate publication of hers to date.
*Rita is voiced by [[Annette Badland]] in the audiobook version of {{QTA|R}}.<ref name="QTAaudio">[https://www.pottermore.com/news/andrew-lincoln-to-narrate-new-digital-audio-book-of-jk-rowling-quidditch-through-the-ages News: "Andrew Lincoln will narrate new digital audiobook of Quidditch Through the Ages"] at {{PM}}</ref>
*In {{HM}}, Rita appears in the side quest "''Daily Prophet'' Cover Competition", where she set a competition in [[Potions (class)|Potions]], [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]], [[Charms (class)|Charms]], and [[duelling]]. As [[Jacob's sibling]]'s house had been trailing in the [[House Cup]] for some time, despite carrying the house all year, it was a good chance to praise the professors after the lesson to gain points in Charms and Transfiguration. In the duelling portion, Jacob's sibling could choose to duel against [[Merula Snyde]], [[Penny Haywood]], or [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]], the strongest duellist of the three.

===Author's comments===
In an interview Edinburgh World Book Fair 2004, J.K.Rowling says:
"'I didn’t realise that by the time I wrote book four I would have met quite a lot of Ritas and people would assume that I was writing Rita in response to what had happened to me, which was not in fact the truth. However, I am not going to deny that writing Rita was a lot more fun having met a few people I had met. I actually quite like Rita. She is loathsome—morally, she’s horrible—but I can’t help admiring her toughness. She is very determined to do the job and there is something quite engaging about that. There is more to come on Rita.'"

===In films===
*Rita Skeeter was portrayed by [[England|English]] actress [[Miranda Richardson]] in {{GOF|FA}}<ref name="imdb"/> and {{DH|F1}},<ref name="imdb"/><ref>[http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/miranda-richardson-reprise-rita-skeeter-role-deathly-hallows-70121/ Miranda Richardson to reprise Rita Skeeter role in Deathly Hallows] - Snitchseeker</ref> who portrayed Mrs Melisha Tweedy in ''Chicken Run'' and ''Chicken Run: Dawn Of The Nugget'', Queen Elizabeth I in'' Blackadder'', Mrs Rose Arbutnot in ''Enchanted April'', Lady Mary Van Tassel in ''Sleepy Hollow'' (who is also a witch, albeit an evil one), and Madame Giry in ''The Phantom Of The Opera''.<ref name="imdb">[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001669/ Miranda Richardson] - IMDb</ref>
*In {{GOF|FA}}, Rita uses a spiral-bound [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] legal pad to conduct Harry's "interview." She is also seen using a Muggle ink pen during [[Igor Karkaroff]]'s trial. It is established in the literary [[canon]] that the wizarding world uses loose parchment and quills for writing.
*Skeeter was not revealed to be an [[Animagus]] in {{GOF|FA}}, and thus it did not include Hermione's later blackmailing of her.
*In {{GOF|FA}}, when Harry points out that they're in a broom cupboard, Rita points out that he should "feel right at home", referring to the fact that Harry in his earlier life lived in the [[Cupboard Under the Stairs|cupboard under the stairs]] at the [[Dursley family|Dursley]] [[4 Privet Drive|house]], hinting she knew about his childhood. Alternatively, she could have been alerting to the fact that it contained brooms, referring to his love of flying and [[Quidditch]], or otherwise hinting that Harry, like a number of students before him, was used to spending time kissing in broom cupboards, despite the fact that he didn't have his first kiss until his [[fifth year]] in the [[Room of Requirement]].
*Although Rita has three gold teeth in the books, she does not in {{GOF|FA}}. Miranda Richardson and director [[Mike Newell]] both felt that they were not right for Rita, with Miranda pointing out that gold teeth would make Rita appear 'unapproachable'. Instead, she chose to have a diamond in one of her teeth, saying that it was "the perfect embellishment for... an amalgam of sparkling brilliance and total hardness".
*Rita does not appear in {{OOTP|FA}}.
*In {{HPLE}}, it is described that, in the films, it was conceived by [[Jany Temime]] that Rita would always dress for the story that she was reporting on.
