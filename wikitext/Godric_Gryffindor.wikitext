'''Godric Gryffindor''' (fl. c. [[First millennium A.D.|993]]) was an [[England|English]] [[wizardkind|wizard]] and one of the [[Hogwarts founders|four founders]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He was great friends with [[Salazar Slytherin]], but opposed him when he later thought that they should not accept [[Muggle-born]] students at Hogwarts. It is unknown when he died. In his honour, Gryffindor's birthplace became known as [[Godric's Hollow]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|Bold Gryffindor, from wild moor...|The [[Sorting Hat]] singing about the founders' birthplaces|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
Gryffindor hailed from a moor which was known as [[Godric's Hollow]],<ref name="DH">{{DH}}</ref> a small West Country village in [[England]]. He was described as being "the best [[Duelling|duellist]] of his time",<ref name="WOTM">[[Wizard of the Month]], July 2007, on [https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20070724183225/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/wotm.cfm J.K. Rowling's official website]</ref> both with a wand and a [[Sword of Gryffindor|sword]].<ref name="HMHO">{{HM|3|HO}}</ref>

===Hogwarts founder===
{{Quote|We'll teach all those with brave deeds to their name.|Gryffindor's preference of students|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Said to be one of "''the four most brilliant witches and wizards of the time''",<ref name="CS9"/> Godric Gryffindor founded [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in his adulthood, with friends [[Salazar Slytherin]], [[Helga Hufflepuff]], and [[Rowena Ravenclaw]], though he later severed ties with Slytherin. He even appeared to have carefully selected members of [[Gryffindor|his own House]].

[[File:Godric Gryffindor.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Godric Gryffindor with his sword]]
Gryffindor was said to have praised courage, determination, and strength of heart above all other qualities. Indeed, he selected students for his house based upon their daring and bravery, according to the [[Sorting Hat]]. He also was the most in favour of allowing [[Muggle-born]]s into the school.

The founders, however, were unsure of how they would sort the students when they were dead. To solve this, Gryffindor took off his hat and all four of them enchanted it so that it could sort the students long after their deaths. It was, from then on, known as the [[Sorting Hat]].

Gryffindor was initially a close friend of [[Salazar Slytherin]], but over time their friendship deteriorated. After a number of years of working peacefully together, Slytherin eventually grew apart from his fellow founders due to his distrust of Muggle-borns, and his belief that they should not be accepted into [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. When Slytherin failed to convince Gryffindor and the others to accept his ideas, he chose to leave the school. Unbeknownst to Gryffindor, his former friend built a [[Chamber of Secrets|hidden chamber]] within the castle, in which he hid a [[Serpent of Slytherin|basilisk]] that his heir would later use to try and purge the school of Muggle-borns.

At some point in his life, Gryffindor commissioned a sword from the goblins, made from their specially wrought silver, encrusted with rubies and with his own name engraved in the flat of the blade. The weapon was forged to Gryffindor's exacting specifications by [[King]] [[Ragnuk|Ragnuk the First]], in accordance with goblin culture, and Gryffindor was left very pleased by the finished product. However, Ragnuk was not happy at handing over what he considered his finest work and sought to steal it back; spreading false tales of Gryffindor having stolen it from him, Ragnuk sent numerous goblins to attack Gryffindor and retrieve the sword. Gryffindor proved far too powerful to overcome, however, and though he did not kill any of the goblins, merely bewitching and sending them back to their king, he did so with a warning to never again try to steal his sword from him on pain of being far less merciful. Ragnuk never dared to test this threat, but remained resentful of the great wizard until his death and beyond.<ref name="PM-sword" />

It is unknown how or when Gryffindor died, though he left an enduring legacy.

===Post-mortem===
A portrait of Gryffindor hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]] guarded a secret short cut between the seventh-floor landing of the [[Grand Staircase]] and the [[Entrance Hall]] side room. The password required to gain access to said shortcut was ''Starshine''.<ref>{{POA|G}} - PC version</ref> Gryffindor left two known relics: his [[goblin]]-made [[Sword of Gryffindor|sword]] (adorned with rubies) and the [[Sorting Hat]]. The two items share a particular bond; whenever a "true [[Gryffindor]]" needs it, the Sword will let itself be pulled out of the hat. 

Godric's sword was capable of acquiring powers from those it had slain and thus was imbued with venom from [[Harry Potter]]'s defeat of the [[Serpent of Slytherin|Basilisk]], making it suitable as a tool for destroying [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s [[Horcrux]]es. [[Albus Dumbledore]] used it to destroy [[Marvolo Gaunt]]'s [[Marvolo Gaunt's Ring|Ring]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] used it to eliminate [[Salazar Slytherin]]'s [[Slytherin's Locket|Locket]], and [[Neville Longbottom]] used it to kill [[Nagini]], the final [[Horcrux]].

==Physical description==
Godric Gryffindor's portrait depicted him as a tall, muscular man with a lion-like mane of wavy red hair and a beard to match. He had green eyes, peach-coloured skin and was often shown with his famous sword, with which he had great skill in wielding. 

He had also been shown as wearing segmented red sword gauntlets adorned with gold fittings that were often depicted as being rather worn and burned-looking. He was also shown as wearing magnificent red robes with gold highlights and rather intricate designs on the sleeves. He was also frequently depicted with a rather powerful and stern gaze.

==Personality and traits==
Godric Gryffindor valued courage, determination, chivalry, and strength of heart, and was described as one of the four most brilliant witches and wizards of his time. He was also the most tolerant and accepting of [[Muggle-born]]s out of the Founders, a point which brought about the end of his friendship with [[Salazar Slytherin]]. He was very forward thinking due to his creating the Sorting Hat to preserve the selection of the students after his time. This showcases his cleverness and creativity.

He also had a versatile mindset as he chose to wield a sword as well as a wand, making him a rather dynamic man who deferred to the duelling style of his opponent, Muggle and wizard alike. Going along with this, it shows that he was respectful and fair, choosing to wield a sword instead of magic against Muggle combatants out of a sense of fair play as magic would be a most decidedly unbalanced weapon in a duel against a simple sword. In addition to showing his sense of fairness, his deference to the duelling style of opponent also shows a need to challenge himself, proving his worth and courage, which became one of the signature traits of his House at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. 

His threat to unsheathe and use his famous blade against [[Ragnuk|Ragnuk the First]] and his followers shows that despite his noble heart and good intentions, that Godric was very much capable of taking the lives of sapient beings such as [[goblin]]s. This would not have been an uncommon trait for a man of his era or personality due to the constant violence that pervaded medieval Europe and the acceptability of duelling to the death among both wizard and Muggles alike.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Godric Gryffindor was said to be the greatest duellist of his time with considerable talent in [[martial magic]], and was also highly skilled in [[Muggle duelling]], using his sword in combat. His skill as a swordsman was such that he preferred to duel Muggles with his sword instead of his magic, despite magic being the more decisive and powerful weapon.<ref name="PM-sword">{{HPcom|the-sword-of-gryffindor}}</ref>
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Godric was shown to be highly proficient in charm-work, as he helped enchant the [[Sorting Hat]] into a sentient [[magic]]al artefact with personality, to [[Sorting Ceremony|sort]] students after his lifetime, with the help of the other founders.<ref name="PM-sorting-hat"/> He was also capable of producing a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]],<ref name="LEGOY2"/> a testament to his superior magical abilities as a [[Wizardkind|wizard]], given the immense difficulty of conjuring a Patronus.

==Possessions==
*'''Wand''': Gryffindor owned a wand made of an unknown wood, length, core, and flexibility.
*'''[[Sword of Gryffindor|Sword]]''': Gryffindor owned a [[goblin]]-made sword made from [[goblin-wrought silver]]. Gryffindor used this sword in [[Muggle duelling]].
*'''[[Sorting Hat]]''': Gryffindor was said to have owned the Sorting Hat. He, alongside the other four founders, [[Charm|enchanted]] the Sorting Hat into a sentient artefact to sort students into appropriate [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] Houses after his lifetime.<ref name="PM-sorting-hat">{{HPcom|the-sorting-hat}}</ref>

==Etymology==
*His surname is a reference to the half-lion magical beast, the Griffin, a fierce, legendary beast with the body of a lion, and the head and wings of an eagle. The Hogwarts house named after him uses a lion as its symbol. Furthermore, the last part of his surname, "dor", is similar to both the French ''d'or'', "made from gold", "golden", which is one of the colours of his Hogwarts House, or the suffix ''dore'', which means "gift of", in which case the meaning of "Gryffindor" would be "gift of the Gryffin".
*Gryffindor is a play on the golden griffin, which is a lion that only has eagle wings, so it has the head and front paws of a lion, and has golden fur and feathers. Even the French for Griffindor, Griffondor is a French homophone for the actual beast, Griffon d'Or.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Godric Gryffindor.png|150px|thumb|Godric Gryffindor in {{LEGO|Y2}}]]
[[File:GodricGryffindorLEGO.jpg|150px|thumb|Godric Gryffindor as a LEGO mini-figure]]
*Godric Gryffindor was named the [[July]] 2007 "Wizard of the Month" on Rowling's website. "One of the four famous founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Godric Gryffindor was the most accomplished dueller of his time, an enlightened fighter against Muggle-discrimination and the first owner of the celebrated Sorting Hat."
*J.K. Rowling once jokingly stated that if Godric Gryffindor was still alive: he would be the [[Giant Squid]] that lives in Hogwarts lake, that would make him the biggest [[Animagus]] (and, quite possibly, the oldest) in the [[Wizarding world]]. At the eleventh hour of each night the squid would change back into Gryffindor, who would wander the school grounds before returning to his squid form. It should be noted that Rowling was joking, so obviously this statement is not considered canon.
*Godric Gryffindor is the only founder who is not mentioned to have any descendants, although for a time it was speculated that Harry Potter himself was a descendant of Gryffindor either through [[James Potter (I)|James Potter]] possibly because James hailed from Godric's hometown, or possibly through a line of Muggles descended from a [[Squib]] to James's wife [[Lily Potter (I)|Lily Evans]]. However, this theory was later debunked by [[J. K. Rowling]] in an interview.<ref>http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-3.htm</ref>
*Gryffindor appears in the queue of the {{HPFJ}} ride inside of {{WWHP}} at both {{W|Universal Studios Orlando}} and {{W|Universal Studios Hollywood}} as a [[portrait]].
*On the official website of {{WWHP}}, Godric mentions that he is proud to have [[Harry Potter]] in his house and calls him "A remarkable young man".
*Gryffindor's name and birthplace may allude to the Hardy Boys story "The Witchmaster's Key", which references the fictional village of Gruffinmoor.
*Godric of Finchale was a medieval English merchant and a famous, though not officially canonised, saint. He was known for his kindness to animals, hiding a [[stag]] being chased by hunters and allowing [[Snake|snakes]] to warm themselves by his fire.
*The real-world Gryffindor family name is apparently of [[Wales|Welsh]] origin, although it spread to [[Ireland]] in the 12th century.<ref>[https://www.houseofnames.com/gryffindor-family-crest "Gryffindor Family Crest and Name History" at houseofnames.com]</ref>
*A new species of spider was named after Gryffindor, ''{{W|Eriovixia gryffindori}}''. The name was chosen due to the spider's triangular body's resemblance to the [[Sorting Hat]], of which Gryffindor was the first owner.<ref>http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/14/world/spider-india-harry-potter-hat-gryffindor/index.html</ref>
