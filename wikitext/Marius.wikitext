'''Marius''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was assigned to [[Gringotts Guards|guard the entrance]] of [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] in [[1998]] during the [[Death Eaters]]' reign over the [[wizarding world]]. He and [[Unidentified Gringotts guard (I)|another guard]] used [[Probity Probe]]s to search anyone attempting to enter. Both guards were [[Confundus Charm|Confunded]] by [[Harry Potter]] on [[1 May]] [[1998]] when he and his friends [[Break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank (1998)|broke into the bank]] to steal one of [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s [[Horcrux]]es from the [[Lestrange Vault]].<ref name="DH26">{{DH|B|26}}</ref>
